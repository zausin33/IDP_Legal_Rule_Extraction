CAUSALITY BETWEEN ATMOSPHERIC PROCESSES AND ARCTIC SEA ICE VARIATIONS
Due to the two-way interactions between the atmosphere and sea ice, studying causality between them is a challenging but
important task, which makes it an area of high interest within polar climate community. The sea ice variations can be
caused by different dynamical and thermodynamical processes. Important dynamical processes include anomalous surface
wind (Spreen et al., 2011; Wu et al., 2012), regional atmospheric circulation patterns (Overland and Wang, 2010;
Screen et al., 2018; Rinke et al., 2019) and abnormal storm activities (Simmonds et al., 2008; Simmonds and Keay, 2009;
Screen et al., 2011; Simmonds and Rudeva, 2012; Parkinson and Comiso, 2013; Simmonds and Rudeva, 2014). Cloud (Kapsch
et al., 2013), radiation (Kay and Gettelman, 2009; Choi et al., 2014) and precipitation (Boisvert et al., 2018; Wang
et al., 2019; Marcovecchio et al., 2021) are the important thermodynamic factors controlling Arctic sea ice trends
and variability. On the other hand, sea ice decline in turn exerts large influence on the atmosphere, including
cloud (Kay and Gettelman, 2009; Morrison et al., 2018), surface energy budget (Semmler et al., 2012; Boisvert et al.,
2015; Boisvert and Stroeve, 2015), precipitation (Bintanja and Selten, 2014; Kopec et al., 2016) and large-scale
circulation (Chemke et al., 2019; Kennel and Yulaeva, 2020). Figure 1 depicts the causal relations between key
atmospheric variables and sea ice over the Arctic. The sea ice here represents sea ice coverage and/or sea ice
thickness. Note that the processes a − d are well-known atmospheric processes, including cloud microphysics,
thermodynamics, radiation, climate dynamics, which have been studied over the past few decades. The processes
e − i are summarized from more recent publications, which are still under investigation by climate scientists.
We will explain processes e − i in details in the next paragraph. The arrow e represents the two-way effect between
sea ice and net longwave flux at the surface. Based on global reanalysis (Kapsch et al., 2013; Lee et al., 2017),
surface (Cox et al., 2016) and satellite observations (Huang et al., 2017), as well as model simulations (Kapsch et
al., 2016; Huang et al., 2019a), the downward longwave radiation at the surface dominates surface warming and
therefore enhances sea ice melt in winter and spring. The increase in downward longwave flux is a result of an
increase in cloudiness and moisture in the Arctic Basin, which is caused by enhanced local evaporation or moisture
transport from mid-latitudes (Luo et al., 2017). Positive anomalies of longwave flux in spring and early summer
initiate an earlier melt onset, thereby triggering several feedback mechanisms which amplify melt during the
succeeding months (Kapsch et al., 2016; Huang et al., 2019b). The sea ice melt increases the air temperature
and thus increases the longwave flux at the FIGURE 1 | The causality graph between key atmospheric variables and

processes a − d are well-known atmospheric processes, which can be summarized from multiple textbooks.

Huang et al. Arctic Sea Ice Causality Discovery surface. The downward shortwave flux, however, appears only
important after the melt has started (Kapsch et al., 2013; Huang et al., 2017). Once the surface albedo is
significantly reduced due to sea ice melt, the solar radiation could be absorbed by ocean, which further
accelerates ice melt in late spring and summer (Kay and Gettelman, 2009; Choi et al., 2014; Kapsch et al., 2016).
The feedback between surface net shortwave flux and sea ice, represented by arrow f in Figure 1, has been
confirmed by both model simulations (Kapsch et al., 2016) and satellite observations (Kay and Gettelman, 2009;
Nussbaumer and Pinker, 2012; Choi et al., 2014). The arrows g indicate the interactions between the sea ice variations
and atmospheric dynamical processes. A series of studies demonstrated that recent loss of Arctic sea ice is triggered
by the atmospheric circulation changes such as a tendency toward a dipole pattern in the mean sea level pressure trend
with an increase over the Arctic Ocean and a decrease over Siberia. The Arctic dipole anomaly in summer
(Wang et al., 2009), winter (Watanabe et al., 2006) and spring (Kapsch et al., 2019) produces a strong meridional
wind (v-component) anomaly that drives more sea ice out of the Arctic Ocean. In addition, this dipole anomaly promotes
transport of heat and moisture and thus enhances downward longwave radiation and control the melt onset
(Huang et al., 2019b; Kapsch et al., 2019). Moreover, the changes in cyclone occurrence and/or depth during spring
(Screen et al., 2011) and summer (Simmonds and Rudeva, 2012) have preconditioning effects on the sea ice cover and
exert a strong influence on the amount of sea ice that survives the melt season. A recent study also pointed out that
a stronger anticyclonic circulation over Greenland and the Arctic Ocean in the troposphere may have contributed as much
as 60% to the September sea ice extent decline since 1979, by warming and moistening the lower atmosphere
(Ding et al., 2017; Huang et al., 2021; Luo et al., 2021). On the other hand, the reduction in Arctic sea ice extent
and increase in open water area in late summer are found to directly contribute to a modification of large-scale
FIGURE 2 | The study area (60°N northward). The circle of 60°N is marked in red. Depending on the season, sea ice

Huang et al. Arctic Sea Ice Causality Discovery circulation patterns in the following autumn through the additional
heat stored in the Arctic Ocean and released to the atmosphere during the autumn (Overland and Wang, 2010). The
increased 1,000–500 hPa thickness in autumn produce anomalous easterley zonal wind component (u-component), especially
over the north of Alaska and Canada. Moreover, a more meridional flow pattern associated with sea ice reduction have
an impact on the mid-latitude weather (Overland and Wang, 2010). These conclusions are mainly drawn from model
simulations (Watanabe et al., 2006; Rinke et al., 2019), reanalysis and observations (Wang et al., 2009; Overland and
Wang, 2010; Kapsch et al., 2019). In addition to radiation, the sensible plus latent heat flux also plays an important
role in the Arctic energy budget. The increase in the downward moisture flux triggers the melting of the sea ice in
spring (Boisvert et al., 2015; Boisvert and Stroeve, 2015; Marcovecchio et al., 2021). Earlier melt onset and loss of
sea ice in the spring enhance warming of the ice-free ocean surface, which in turn leads to an increase of evaporation
from the surface into the atmosphere in the autumn. This positive feedback between heat flux and sea ice, indicated
by arrow h, has been confirmed by satellite observations (Boisvert et al., 2015; Boisvert and Stroeve, 2015) and model
simulations (Huang et al., 2019a) during most months of the year. The arrow i represents the influence of precipitation
on Arctic sea ice variations. Specifically, the magnitude of precipitation accumulating over the sea ice pack largely
determines the depth of the snow layer, which modulates the rate of sea ice growth because of its highly insulating
properties (Sturm et al., 2002). The phase of the precipitation falling on the sea ice pack is also important. As rain,
it can melt, compact, and densify the snowpack, thus reducing the surface albedo and promoting sea ice melt (Perovich
et al., 2002).The recent snowfall decline in summer is essentially caused by changes in precipitation form (snow
turning to rain) with very little influence of decreases in total precipitation, which is a result of
lower-atmospheric warming. Then the loss of snow-on-ice results in a substantial decrease in the surface albedo over
the Arctic Ocean, causing additional surface ice melt by absorbing more solar radiation (Screen and Simmonds, 2012).
These conclusions are mainly drawn from in-situ measurements during field campaign (Perovich et al., 2002; Sturm et al.,
2002), global reanalysis products and surface observations (Screen and Simmonds, 2012; Boisvert et al., 2018;
Wang et al., 2019). The higher precipitation and snowfall could result in a thicker snowpack that allows less heat
loss to the atmosphere. More importantly, modeling studies suggest that increases in Arctic precipitation over the
21st century, particularly in late autumn and winter, are due mainly to strongly intensified local surface evaporation
(latent heat flux) (Bintanja and Selten, 2014). Therefore, we believe that Arctic precipitation exerts direct influence
on sea ice variations (arrow i), while sea ice modulates precipitation mainly through sensible plus latent heat flux
(arrows h, b). Among these studies, very few of them have demonstrated the delayed impact of one variable on another.
Specifically, the net shortwave flux at the surface in early summer (May–July) is found to enhance sea ice melt with a
lag of 1–4 months (Choi et al., 2014). Moreover, the sea ice condition exhibits the delayed impacts on itself, which is
called sea ice anomaly persistence (Guemas et al., 2016; Cruz-García et al., 2019; Holland et al., 2019). The sea ice
anomaly persistence depends on the predictand (area, extent, volume), region, and the initial and target dates, which
can be varied from a few days to a few years (Guemas et al., 2016). With sea ice anomaly persistence,
there is predictability for the sea ice area in winter but low predictability throughout the rest of the year in
peripheral seas. Based on multiple model simulations, the Labrador Sea stands out among the considered regions,
with sea ice predictability extending up to 1.5 years (Cruz-García et al., 2019). Note that most of studies mentioned
above determine the changes in one variable, happening before another one, by applying time series analysis and/or
composite analysis based on observations, reanalysis or model output (Perovich et al., 2002; Sturm et al., 2002; Kay
and Gettelman, 2009; Wang et al., 2009; Nussbaumer and Pinker, 2012; Kapsch et al., 2013; Choi et al., 2014; Boisvert
et al., 2015; Boisvert and Stroeve, 2015; Cox et al., 2016; Huang et al., 2017; Huang et al., 2019b; Boisvert et al.,
2018; Wang et al., 2019). Among them, some studies use more advanced statistical analysis such as empirical orthogonal
function (Watanabe et al., 2006; Overland and Wang, 2010) and self-organizing map (Kapsch et al., 2019; Rinke et al.,
2019). Other studies assess the causal links through targeted modeling experiments (Bintanja and Selten, 2014; Kapsch
et al., 2016; Ding et al., 2017; Huang et al., 2019a; Cruz-García et al., 2019), in order to test whether a manipulation
of one variable has an impact on others. And most of the studies focus on relationships between only one or two
atmospheric processes with changes in Arctic sea ice. Therefore, in this study, we target to provide a more
comprehensive analysis about causality between multiple atmospheric processes and sea ice by applying different
data-driven causality approaches.
