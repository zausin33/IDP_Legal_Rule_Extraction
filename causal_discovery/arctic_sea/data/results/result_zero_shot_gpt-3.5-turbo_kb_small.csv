Huang et al. Arctic Sea Ice Causality Discovery surface. The downward shortwave flux, however, appears only
important after the melt has started (Kapsch et al., 2013; Huang et al., 2017). Once the surface albedo is
significantly reduced due to sea ice melt, the solar radiation could be absorbed by ocean, which further
accelerates ice melt in late spring and summer (Kay and Gettelman, 2009; Choi et al., 2014; Kapsch et al., 2016).
The feedback between surface net shortwave flux and sea ice, represented by arrow f in Figure 1, has been
confirmed by both model simulations (Kapsch et al., 2016) and satellite observations (Kay and Gettelman, 2009;
Nussbaumer and Pinker, 2012; Choi et al., 2014). The arrows g indicate the interactions between the sea ice variations
and atmospheric dynamical processes. A series of studies demonstrated that recent loss of Arctic sea ice is triggered
by the atmospheric circulation changes such as a tendency toward a dipole pattern in the mean sea level pressure trend
with an increase over the Arctic Ocean and a decrease over Siberia. The Arctic dipole anomaly in summer
(Wang et al., 2009), winter (Watanabe et al., 2006) and spring (Kapsch et al., 2019) produces a strong meridional
wind (v-component) anomaly that drives more sea ice out of the Arctic Ocean. In addition, this dipole anomaly promotes
transport of heat and moisture and thus enhances downward longwave radiation and control the melt onset
(Huang et al., 2019b; Kapsch et al., 2019). Moreover, the changes in cyclone occurrence and/or depth during spring
(Screen et al., 2011) and summer (Simmonds and Rudeva, 2012) have preconditioning effects on the sea ice cover and
exert a strong influence on the amount of sea ice that survives the melt season. A recent study also pointed out that
a stronger anticyclonic circulation over Greenland and the Arctic Ocean in the troposphere may have contributed as much
as 60% to the September sea ice extent decline since 1979, by warming and moistening the lower atmosphere

These conclusions are mainly drawn from in-situ measurements during field campaign (Perovich et al., 2002; Sturm et al.,
2002), global reanalysis products and surface observations (Screen and Simmonds, 2012; Boisvert et al., 2018;
Wang et al., 2019). The higher precipitation and snowfall could result in a thicker snowpack that allows less heat
loss to the atmosphere. More importantly, modeling studies suggest that increases in Arctic precipitation over the
21st century, particularly in late autumn and winter, are due mainly to strongly intensified local surface evaporation
(latent heat flux) (Bintanja and Selten, 2014). Therefore, we believe that Arctic precipitation exerts direct influence
on sea ice variations (arrow i), while sea ice modulates precipitation mainly through sensible plus latent heat flux
(arrows h, b). Among these studies, very few of them have demonstrated the delayed impact of one variable on another.
Specifically, the net shortwave flux at the surface in early summer (Mayâ€“July) is found to enhance sea ice melt with a
lag of 1â€“4 months (Choi et al., 2014). Moreover, the sea ice condition exhibits the delayed impacts on itself, which is
called sea ice anomaly persistence (Guemas et al., 2016; Cruz-GarcÃ­a et al., 2019; Holland et al., 2019). The sea ice
anomaly persistence depends on the predictand (area, extent, volume), region, and the initial and target dates, which
can be varied from a few days to a few years (Guemas et al., 2016). With sea ice anomaly persistence,
there is predictability for the sea ice area in winter but low predictability throughout the rest of the year in
peripheral seas. Based on multiple model simulations, the Labrador Sea stands out among the considered regions,
with sea ice predictability extending up to 1.5 years (Cruz-GarcÃ­a et al., 2019). Note that most of studies mentioned
above determine the changes in one variable, happening before another one, by applying time series analysis and/or
composite analysis based on observations, reanalysis or model output (Perovich et al., 2002; Sturm et al., 2002; Kay
and Gettelman, 2009; Wang et al., 2009; Nussbaumer and Pinker, 2012; Kapsch et al., 2013; Choi et al., 2014; Boisvert

2018; Wang et al., 2019). Among them, some studies use more advanced statistical analysis such as empirical orthogonal
function (Watanabe et al., 2006; Overland and Wang, 2010) and self-organizing map (Kapsch et al., 2019; Rinke et al.,
2019). Other studies assess the causal links through targeted modeling experiments (Bintanja and Selten, 2014; Kapsch
et al., 2016; Ding et al., 2017; Huang et al., 2019a; Cruz-GarcÃ­a et al., 2019), in order to test whether a manipulation
of one variable has an impact on others. And most of the studies focus on relationships between only one or two

(Ding et al., 2017; Huang et al., 2021; Luo et al., 2021). On the other hand, the reduction in Arctic sea ice extent
and increase in open water area in late summer are found to directly contribute to a modification of large-scale

Huang et al. Arctic Sea Ice Causality Discovery circulation patterns in the following autumn through the additional
heat stored in the Arctic Ocean and released to the atmosphere during the autumn (Overland and Wang, 2010). The
increased 1,000â€“500 hPa thickness in autumn produce anomalous easterley zonal wind component (u-component), especially
over the north of Alaska and Canada. Moreover, a more meridional flow pattern associated with sea ice reduction have
an impact on the mid-latitude weather (Overland and Wang, 2010). These conclusions are mainly drawn from model
simulations (Watanabe et al., 2006; Rinke et al., 2019), reanalysis and observations (Wang et al., 2009; Overland and
Wang, 2010; Kapsch et al., 2019). In addition to radiation, the sensible plus latent heat flux also plays an important
role in the Arctic energy budget. The increase in the downward moisture flux triggers the melting of the sea ice in
spring (Boisvert et al., 2015; Boisvert and Stroeve, 2015; Marcovecchio et al., 2021). Earlier melt onset and loss of
sea ice in the spring enhance warming of the ice-free ocean surface, which in turn leads to an increase of evaporation
from the surface into the atmosphere in the autumn. This positive feedback between heat flux and sea ice, indicated
by arrow h, has been confirmed by satellite observations (Boisvert et al., 2015; Boisvert and Stroeve, 2015) and model
simulations (Huang et al., 2019a) during most months of the year. The arrow i represents the influence of precipitation
on Arctic sea ice variations. Specifically, the magnitude of precipitation accumulating over the sea ice pack largely
determines the depth of the snow layer, which modulates the rate of sea ice growth because of its highly insulating
properties (Sturm et al., 2002). The phase of the precipitation falling on the sea ice pack is also important. As rain,
it can melt, compact, and densify the snowpack, thus reducing the surface albedo and promoting sea ice melt (Perovich
et al., 2002).The recent snowfall decline in summer is essentially caused by changes in precipitation form (snow
turning to rain) with very little influence of decreases in total precipitation, which is a result of
lower-atmospheric warming. Then the loss of snow-on-ice results in a substantial decrease in the surface albedo over
the Arctic Ocean, causing additional surface ice melt by absorbing more solar radiation (Screen and Simmonds, 2012).

CAUSALITY BETWEEN ATMOSPHERIC PROCESSES AND ARCTIC SEA ICE VARIATIONS
Due to the two-way interactions between the atmosphere and sea ice, studying causality between them is a challenging but
important task, which makes it an area of high interest within polar climate community. The sea ice variations can be
caused by different dynamical and thermodynamical processes. Important dynamical processes include anomalous surface
wind (Spreen et al., 2011; Wu et al., 2012), regional atmospheric circulation patterns (Overland and Wang, 2010;
Screen et al., 2018; Rinke et al., 2019) and abnormal storm activities (Simmonds et al., 2008; Simmonds and Keay, 2009;
Screen et al., 2011; Simmonds and Rudeva, 2012; Parkinson and Comiso, 2013; Simmonds and Rudeva, 2014). Cloud (Kapsch
et al., 2013), radiation (Kay and Gettelman, 2009; Choi et al., 2014) and precipitation (Boisvert et al., 2018; Wang
et al., 2019; Marcovecchio et al., 2021) are the important thermodynamic factors controlling Arctic sea ice trends
and variability. On the other hand, sea ice decline in turn exerts large influence on the atmosphere, including
cloud (Kay and Gettelman, 2009; Morrison et al., 2018), surface energy budget (Semmler et al., 2012; Boisvert et al.,
2015; Boisvert and Stroeve, 2015), precipitation (Bintanja and Selten, 2014; Kopec et al., 2016) and large-scale
circulation (Chemke et al., 2019; Kennel and Yulaeva, 2020). Figure 1 depicts the causal relations between key
atmospheric variables and sea ice over the Arctic. The sea ice here represents sea ice coverage and/or sea ice
thickness. Note that the processes a âˆ’ d are well-known atmospheric processes, including cloud microphysics,
thermodynamics, radiation, climate dynamics, which have been studied over the past few decades. The processes
e âˆ’ i are summarized from more recent publications, which are still under investigation by climate scientists.
We will explain processes e âˆ’ i in details in the next paragraph. The arrow e represents the two-way effect between
sea ice and net longwave flux at the surface. Based on global reanalysis (Kapsch et al., 2013; Lee et al., 2017),
surface (Cox et al., 2016) and satellite observations (Huang et al., 2017), as well as model simulations (Kapsch et
al., 2016; Huang et al., 2019a), the downward longwave radiation at the surface dominates surface warming and
therefore enhances sea ice melt in winter and spring. The increase in downward longwave flux is a result of an
increase in cloudiness and moisture in the Arctic Basin, which is caused by enhanced local evaporation or moisture
transport from mid-latitudes (Luo et al., 2017). Positive anomalies of longwave flux in spring and early summer
initiate an earlier melt onset, thereby triggering several feedback mechanisms which amplify melt during the
succeeding months (Kapsch et al., 2016; Huang et al., 2019b). The sea ice melt increases the air temperature

atmospheric processes with changes in Arctic sea ice. Therefore, in this study, we target to provide a more
comprehensive analysis about causality between multiple atmospheric processes and sea ice by applying different
data-driven causality approaches.

with an increase over the Arctic Ocean and a decrease over Siberia. The Arctic dipole anomaly in summer
(Wang et al., 2009), winter (Watanabe et al., 2006) and spring (Kapsch et al., 2019) produces a strong meridional
wind (v-component) anomaly that drives more sea ice out of the Arctic Ocean. In addition, this dipole anomaly promotes
transport of heat and moisture and thus enhances downward longwave radiation and control the melt onset
(Huang et al., 2019b; Kapsch et al., 2019). Moreover, the changes in cyclone occurrence and/or depth during spring
(Screen et al., 2011) and summer (Simmonds and Rudeva, 2012) have preconditioning effects on the sea ice cover and
exert a strong influence on the amount of sea ice that survives the melt season. A recent study also pointed out that
a stronger anticyclonic circulation over Greenland and the Arctic Ocean in the troposphere may have contributed as much
as 60% to the September sea ice extent decline since 1979, by warming and moistening the lower atmosphere

These conclusions are mainly drawn from in-situ measurements during field campaign (Perovich et al., 2002; Sturm et al.,
2002), global reanalysis products and surface observations (Screen and Simmonds, 2012; Boisvert et al., 2018;
Wang et al., 2019). The higher precipitation and snowfall could result in a thicker snowpack that allows less heat
loss to the atmosphere. More importantly, modeling studies suggest that increases in Arctic precipitation over the
21st century, particularly in late autumn and winter, are due mainly to strongly intensified local surface evaporation
(latent heat flux) (Bintanja and Selten, 2014). Therefore, we believe that Arctic precipitation exerts direct influence
on sea ice variations (arrow i), while sea ice modulates precipitation mainly through sensible plus latent heat flux
(arrows h, b). Among these studies, very few of them have demonstrated the delayed impact of one variable on another.
Specifically, the net shortwave flux at the surface in early summer (Mayâ€“July) is found to enhance sea ice melt with a
lag of 1â€“4 months (Choi et al., 2014). Moreover, the sea ice condition exhibits the delayed impacts on itself, which is
called sea ice anomaly persistence (Guemas et al., 2016; Cruz-GarcÃ­a et al., 2019; Holland et al., 2019). The sea ice
anomaly persistence depends on the predictand (area, extent, volume), region, and the initial and target dates, which
can be varied from a few days to a few years (Guemas et al., 2016). With sea ice anomaly persistence,
there is predictability for the sea ice area in winter but low predictability throughout the rest of the year in
peripheral seas. Based on multiple model simulations, the Labrador Sea stands out among the considered regions,
with sea ice predictability extending up to 1.5 years (Cruz-GarcÃ­a et al., 2019). Note that most of studies mentioned
above determine the changes in one variable, happening before another one, by applying time series analysis and/or
composite analysis based on observations, reanalysis or model output (Perovich et al., 2002; Sturm et al., 2002; Kay
and Gettelman, 2009; Wang et al., 2009; Nussbaumer and Pinker, 2012; Kapsch et al., 2013; Choi et al., 2014; Boisvert
et al., 2015; Boisvert and Stroeve, 2015; Cox et al., 2016; Huang et al., 2017; Huang et al., 2019b; Boisvert et al.,
2018; Wang et al., 2019). Among them, some studies use more advanced statistical analysis such as empirical orthogonal
function (Watanabe et al., 2006; Overland and Wang, 2010) and self-organizing map (Kapsch et al., 2019; Rinke et al.,
2019). Other studies assess the causal links through targeted modeling experiments (Bintanja and Selten, 2014; Kapsch
et al., 2016; Ding et al., 2017; Huang et al., 2019a; Cruz-GarcÃ­a et al., 2019), in order to test whether a manipulation
of one variable has an impact on others. And most of the studies focus on relationships between only one or two

(Ding et al., 2017; Huang et al., 2021; Luo et al., 2021). On the other hand, the reduction in Arctic sea ice extent
and increase in open water area in late summer are found to directly contribute to a modification of large-scale

Huang et al. Arctic Sea Ice Causality Discovery circulation patterns in the following autumn through the additional
heat stored in the Arctic Ocean and released to the atmosphere during the autumn (Overland and Wang, 2010). The
increased 1,000â€“500 hPa thickness in autumn produce anomalous easterley zonal wind component (u-component), especially
over the north of Alaska and Canada. Moreover, a more meridional flow pattern associated with sea ice reduction have
an impact on the mid-latitude weather (Overland and Wang, 2010). These conclusions are mainly drawn from model
simulations (Watanabe et al., 2006; Rinke et al., 2019), reanalysis and observations (Wang et al., 2009; Overland and
Wang, 2010; Kapsch et al., 2019). In addition to radiation, the sensible plus latent heat flux also plays an important
role in the Arctic energy budget. The increase in the downward moisture flux triggers the melting of the sea ice in
spring (Boisvert et al., 2015; Boisvert and Stroeve, 2015; Marcovecchio et al., 2021). Earlier melt onset and loss of
sea ice in the spring enhance warming of the ice-free ocean surface, which in turn leads to an increase of evaporation
from the surface into the atmosphere in the autumn. This positive feedback between heat flux and sea ice, indicated
by arrow h, has been confirmed by satellite observations (Boisvert et al., 2015; Boisvert and Stroeve, 2015) and model
simulations (Huang et al., 2019a) during most months of the year. The arrow i represents the influence of precipitation
on Arctic sea ice variations. Specifically, the magnitude of precipitation accumulating over the sea ice pack largely
determines the depth of the snow layer, which modulates the rate of sea ice growth because of its highly insulating
properties (Sturm et al., 2002). The phase of the precipitation falling on the sea ice pack is also important. As rain,
it can melt, compact, and densify the snowpack, thus reducing the surface albedo and promoting sea ice melt (Perovich
et al., 2002).The recent snowfall decline in summer is essentially caused by changes in precipitation form (snow
turning to rain) with very little influence of decreases in total precipitation, which is a result of
lower-atmospheric warming. Then the loss of snow-on-ice results in a substantial decrease in the surface albedo over
the Arctic Ocean, causing additional surface ice melt by absorbing more solar radiation (Screen and Simmonds, 2012).

CAUSALITY BETWEEN ATMOSPHERIC PROCESSES AND ARCTIC SEA ICE VARIATIONS
Due to the two-way interactions between the atmosphere and sea ice, studying causality between them is a challenging but
important task, which makes it an area of high interest within polar climate community. The sea ice variations can be
caused by different dynamical and thermodynamical processes. Important dynamical processes include anomalous surface
wind (Spreen et al., 2011; Wu et al., 2012), regional atmospheric circulation patterns (Overland and Wang, 2010;
Screen et al., 2018; Rinke et al., 2019) and abnormal storm activities (Simmonds et al., 2008; Simmonds and Keay, 2009;
Screen et al., 2011; Simmonds and Rudeva, 2012; Parkinson and Comiso, 2013; Simmonds and Rudeva, 2014). Cloud (Kapsch
et al., 2013), radiation (Kay and Gettelman, 2009; Choi et al., 2014) and precipitation (Boisvert et al., 2018; Wang
et al., 2019; Marcovecchio et al., 2021) are the important thermodynamic factors controlling Arctic sea ice trends
and variability. On the other hand, sea ice decline in turn exerts large influence on the atmosphere, including
cloud (Kay and Gettelman, 2009; Morrison et al., 2018), surface energy budget (Semmler et al., 2012; Boisvert et al.,
2015; Boisvert and Stroeve, 2015), precipitation (Bintanja and Selten, 2014; Kopec et al., 2016) and large-scale
circulation (Chemke et al., 2019; Kennel and Yulaeva, 2020). Figure 1 depicts the causal relations between key
atmospheric variables and sea ice over the Arctic. The sea ice here represents sea ice coverage and/or sea ice
thickness. Note that the processes a âˆ’ d are well-known atmospheric processes, including cloud microphysics,
thermodynamics, radiation, climate dynamics, which have been studied over the past few decades. The processes
e âˆ’ i are summarized from more recent publications, which are still under investigation by climate scientists.
We will explain processes e âˆ’ i in details in the next paragraph. The arrow e represents the two-way effect between
sea ice and net longwave flux at the surface. Based on global reanalysis (Kapsch et al., 2013; Lee et al., 2017),
surface (Cox et al., 2016) and satellite observations (Huang et al., 2017), as well as model simulations (Kapsch et
al., 2016; Huang et al., 2019a), the downward longwave radiation at the surface dominates surface warming and
therefore enhances sea ice melt in winter and spring. The increase in downward longwave flux is a result of an
increase in cloudiness and moisture in the Arctic Basin, which is caused by enhanced local evaporation or moisture
transport from mid-latitudes (Luo et al., 2017). Positive anomalies of longwave flux in spring and early summer
initiate an earlier melt onset, thereby triggering several feedback mechanisms which amplify melt during the
succeeding months (Kapsch et al., 2016; Huang et al., 2019b). The sea ice melt increases the air temperature

atmospheric processes with changes in Arctic sea ice. Therefore, in this study, we target to provide a more
comprehensive analysis about causality between multiple atmospheric processes and sea ice by applying different
data-driven causality approaches.

important after the melt has started (Kapsch et al., 2013; Huang et al., 2017). Once the surface albedo is
significantly reduced due to sea ice melt, the solar radiation could be absorbed by ocean, which further
accelerates ice melt in late spring and summer (Kay and Gettelman, 2009; Choi et al., 2014; Kapsch et al., 2016).

function (Watanabe et al., 2006; Overland and Wang, 2010) and self-organizing map (Kapsch et al., 2019; Rinke et al.,

(Ding et al., 2017; Huang et al., 2021; Luo et al., 2021). On the other hand, the reduction in Arctic sea ice extent

Huang et al. Arctic Sea Ice Causality Discovery circulation patterns in the following autumn through the additional
heat stored in the Arctic Ocean and released to the atmosphere during the autumn (Overland and Wang, 2010). The
increased 1,000â€“500 hPa thickness in autumn produce anomalous easterley zonal wind component (u-component), especially
over the north of Alaska and Canada. Moreover, a more meridional flow pattern associated with sea ice reduction have
an impact on the mid-latitude weather (Overland and Wang, 2010). These conclusions are mainly drawn from model
simulations (Watanabe et al., 2006; Rinke et al., 2019), reanalysis and observations (Wang et al., 2009; Overland and
Wang, 2010; Kapsch et al., 2019). In addition to radiation, the sensible plus latent heat flux also plays an important
role in the Arctic energy budget. The increase in the downward moisture flux triggers the melting of the sea ice in
spring (Boisvert et al., 2015; Boisvert and Stroeve, 2015; Marcovecchio et al., 2021). Earlier melt onset and loss of
sea ice in the spring enhance warming of the ice-free ocean surface, which in turn leads to an increase of evaporation
from the surface into the atmosphere in the autumn. This positive feedback between heat flux and sea ice, indicated
by arrow h, has been confirmed by satellite observations (Boisvert et al., 2015; Boisvert and Stroeve, 2015) and model
simulations (Huang et al., 2019a) during most months of the year. The arrow i represents the influence of precipitation
on Arctic sea ice variations. Specifically, the magnitude of precipitation accumulating over the sea ice pack largely
determines the depth of the snow layer, which modulates the rate of sea ice growth because of its highly insulating
properties (Sturm et al., 2002). The phase of the precipitation falling on the sea ice pack is also important. As rain,
it can melt, compact, and densify the snowpack, thus reducing the surface albedo and promoting sea ice melt (Perovich
et al., 2002).The recent snowfall decline in summer is essentially caused by changes in precipitation form (snow
turning to rain) with very little influence of decreases in total precipitation, which is a result of
lower-atmospheric warming. Then the loss of snow-on-ice results in a substantial decrease in the surface albedo over
the Arctic Ocean, causing additional surface ice melt by absorbing more solar radiation (Screen and Simmonds, 2012).

CAUSALITY BETWEEN ATMOSPHERIC PROCESSES AND ARCTIC SEA ICE VARIATIONS
Due to the two-way interactions between the atmosphere and sea ice, studying causality between them is a challenging but
important task, which makes it an area of high interest within polar climate community. The sea ice variations can be
caused by different dynamical and thermodynamical processes. Important dynamical processes include anomalous surface
wind (Spreen et al., 2011; Wu et al., 2012), regional atmospheric circulation patterns (Overland and Wang, 2010;
Screen et al., 2018; Rinke et al., 2019) and abnormal storm activities (Simmonds et al., 2008; Simmonds and Keay, 2009;
Screen et al., 2011; Simmonds and Rudeva, 2012; Parkinson and Comiso, 2013; Simmonds and Rudeva, 2014). Cloud (Kapsch
et al., 2013), radiation (Kay and Gettelman, 2009; Choi et al., 2014) and precipitation (Boisvert et al., 2018; Wang
et al., 2019; Marcovecchio et al., 2021) are the important thermodynamic factors controlling Arctic sea ice trends
and variability. On the other hand, sea ice decline in turn exerts large influence on the atmosphere, including
cloud (Kay and Gettelman, 2009; Morrison et al., 2018), surface energy budget (Semmler et al., 2012; Boisvert et al.,
2015; Boisvert and Stroeve, 2015), precipitation (Bintanja and Selten, 2014; Kopec et al., 2016) and large-scale
circulation (Chemke et al., 2019; Kennel and Yulaeva, 2020). Figure 1 depicts the causal relations between key
atmospheric variables and sea ice over the Arctic. The sea ice here represents sea ice coverage and/or sea ice
thickness. Note that the processes a âˆ’ d are well-known atmospheric processes, including cloud microphysics,
thermodynamics, radiation, climate dynamics, which have been studied over the past few decades. The processes
e âˆ’ i are summarized from more recent publications, which are still under investigation by climate scientists.
We will explain processes e âˆ’ i in details in the next paragraph. The arrow e represents the two-way effect between
sea ice and net longwave flux at the surface. Based on global reanalysis (Kapsch et al., 2013; Lee et al., 2017),
surface (Cox et al., 2016) and satellite observations (Huang et al., 2017), as well as model simulations (Kapsch et
al., 2016; Huang et al., 2019a), the downward longwave radiation at the surface dominates surface warming and
therefore enhances sea ice melt in winter and spring. The increase in downward longwave flux is a result of an
increase in cloudiness and moisture in the Arctic Basin, which is caused by enhanced local evaporation or moisture
transport from mid-latitudes (Luo et al., 2017). Positive anomalies of longwave flux in spring and early summer
initiate an earlier melt onset, thereby triggering several feedback mechanisms which amplify melt during the
succeeding months (Kapsch et al., 2016; Huang et al., 2019b). The sea ice melt increases the air temperature

atmospheric processes with changes in Arctic sea ice. Therefore, in this study, we target to provide a more
comprehensive analysis about causality between multiple atmospheric processes and sea ice by applying different
data-driven causality approaches.

Huang et al. Arctic Sea Ice Causality Discovery surface. The downward shortwave flux, however, appears only
important after the melt has started (Kapsch et al., 2013; Huang et al., 2017). Once the surface albedo is
significantly reduced due to sea ice melt, the solar radiation could be absorbed by ocean, which further
accelerates ice melt in late spring and summer (Kay and Gettelman, 2009; Choi et al., 2014; Kapsch et al., 2016).
The feedback between surface net shortwave flux and sea ice, represented by arrow f in Figure 1, has been
confirmed by both model simulations (Kapsch et al., 2016) and satellite observations (Kay and Gettelman, 2009;
Nussbaumer and Pinker, 2012; Choi et al., 2014). The arrows g indicate the interactions between the sea ice variations
and atmospheric dynamical processes. A series of studies demonstrated that recent loss of Arctic sea ice is triggered
by the atmospheric circulation changes such as a tendency toward a dipole pattern in the mean sea level pressure trend
with an increase over the Arctic Ocean and a decrease over Siberia. The Arctic dipole anomaly in summer
(Wang et al., 2009), winter (Watanabe et al., 2006) and spring (Kapsch et al., 2019) produces a strong meridional
wind (v-component) anomaly that drives more sea ice out of the Arctic Ocean. In addition, this dipole anomaly promotes
transport of heat and moisture and thus enhances downward longwave radiation and control the melt onset
(Huang et al., 2019b; Kapsch et al., 2019). Moreover, the changes in cyclone occurrence and/or depth during spring
(Screen et al., 2011) and summer (Simmonds and Rudeva, 2012) have preconditioning effects on the sea ice cover and
exert a strong influence on the amount of sea ice that survives the melt season. A recent study also pointed out that
a stronger anticyclonic circulation over Greenland and the Arctic Ocean in the troposphere may have contributed as much
as 60% to the September sea ice extent decline since 1979, by warming and moistening the lower atmosphere

These conclusions are mainly drawn from in-situ measurements during field campaign (Perovich et al., 2002; Sturm et al.,
2002), global reanalysis products and surface observations (Screen and Simmonds, 2012; Boisvert et al., 2018;
Wang et al., 2019). The higher precipitation and snowfall could result in a thicker snowpack that allows less heat
loss to the atmosphere. More importantly, modeling studies suggest that increases in Arctic precipitation over the
21st century, particularly in late autumn and winter, are due mainly to strongly intensified local surface evaporation
(latent heat flux) (Bintanja and Selten, 2014). Therefore, we believe that Arctic precipitation exerts direct influence
on sea ice variations (arrow i), while sea ice modulates precipitation mainly through sensible plus latent heat flux
(arrows h, b). Among these studies, very few of them have demonstrated the delayed impact of one variable on another.
Specifically, the net shortwave flux at the surface in early summer (Mayâ€“July) is found to enhance sea ice melt with a
lag of 1â€“4 months (Choi et al., 2014). Moreover, the sea ice condition exhibits the delayed impacts on itself, which is
called sea ice anomaly persistence (Guemas et al., 2016; Cruz-GarcÃ­a et al., 2019; Holland et al., 2019). The sea ice
anomaly persistence depends on the predictand (area, extent, volume), region, and the initial and target dates, which
can be varied from a few days to a few years (Guemas et al., 2016). With sea ice anomaly persistence,
there is predictability for the sea ice area in winter but low predictability throughout the rest of the year in
peripheral seas. Based on multiple model simulations, the Labrador Sea stands out among the considered regions,
with sea ice predictability extending up to 1.5 years (Cruz-GarcÃ­a et al., 2019). Note that most of studies mentioned
above determine the changes in one variable, happening before another one, by applying time series analysis and/or
composite analysis based on observations, reanalysis or model output (Perovich et al., 2002; Sturm et al., 2002; Kay
and Gettelman, 2009; Wang et al., 2009; Nussbaumer and Pinker, 2012; Kapsch et al., 2013; Choi et al., 2014; Boisvert

CAUSALITY BETWEEN ATMOSPHERIC PROCESSES AND ARCTIC SEA ICE VARIATIONS
Due to the two-way interactions between the atmosphere and sea ice, studying causality between them is a challenging but
important task, which makes it an area of high interest within polar climate community. The sea ice variations can be
caused by different dynamical and thermodynamical processes. Important dynamical processes include anomalous surface
wind (Spreen et al., 2011; Wu et al., 2012), regional atmospheric circulation patterns (Overland and Wang, 2010;
Screen et al., 2018; Rinke et al., 2019) and abnormal storm activities (Simmonds et al., 2008; Simmonds and Keay, 2009;
Screen et al., 2011; Simmonds and Rudeva, 2012; Parkinson and Comiso, 2013; Simmonds and Rudeva, 2014). Cloud (Kapsch
et al., 2013), radiation (Kay and Gettelman, 2009; Choi et al., 2014) and precipitation (Boisvert et al., 2018; Wang
et al., 2019; Marcovecchio et al., 2021) are the important thermodynamic factors controlling Arctic sea ice trends
and variability. On the other hand, sea ice decline in turn exerts large influence on the atmosphere, including
cloud (Kay and Gettelman, 2009; Morrison et al., 2018), surface energy budget (Semmler et al., 2012; Boisvert et al.,
2015; Boisvert and Stroeve, 2015), precipitation (Bintanja and Selten, 2014; Kopec et al., 2016) and large-scale
circulation (Chemke et al., 2019; Kennel and Yulaeva, 2020). Figure 1 depicts the causal relations between key
atmospheric variables and sea ice over the Arctic. The sea ice here represents sea ice coverage and/or sea ice
thickness. Note that the processes a âˆ’ d are well-known atmospheric processes, including cloud microphysics,
thermodynamics, radiation, climate dynamics, which have been studied over the past few decades. The processes
e âˆ’ i are summarized from more recent publications, which are still under investigation by climate scientists.
We will explain processes e âˆ’ i in details in the next paragraph. The arrow e represents the two-way effect between
sea ice and net longwave flux at the surface. Based on global reanalysis (Kapsch et al., 2013; Lee et al., 2017),
surface (Cox et al., 2016) and satellite observations (Huang et al., 2017), as well as model simulations (Kapsch et
al., 2016; Huang et al., 2019a), the downward longwave radiation at the surface dominates surface warming and
therefore enhances sea ice melt in winter and spring. The increase in downward longwave flux is a result of an
increase in cloudiness and moisture in the Arctic Basin, which is caused by enhanced local evaporation or moisture
transport from mid-latitudes (Luo et al., 2017). Positive anomalies of longwave flux in spring and early summer
initiate an earlier melt onset, thereby triggering several feedback mechanisms which amplify melt during the
succeeding months (Kapsch et al., 2016; Huang et al., 2019b). The sea ice melt increases the air temperature

atmospheric processes with changes in Arctic sea ice. Therefore, in this study, we target to provide a more
comprehensive analysis about causality between multiple atmospheric processes and sea ice by applying different
data-driven causality approaches.

Huang et al. Arctic Sea Ice Causality Discovery surface. The downward shortwave flux, however, appears only
important after the melt has started (Kapsch et al., 2013; Huang et al., 2017). Once the surface albedo is
significantly reduced due to sea ice melt, the solar radiation could be absorbed by ocean, which further
accelerates ice melt in late spring and summer (Kay and Gettelman, 2009; Choi et al., 2014; Kapsch et al., 2016).
The feedback between surface net shortwave flux and sea ice, represented by arrow f in Figure 1, has been
confirmed by both model simulations (Kapsch et al., 2016) and satellite observations (Kay and Gettelman, 2009;
Nussbaumer and Pinker, 2012; Choi et al., 2014). The arrows g indicate the interactions between the sea ice variations
and atmospheric dynamical processes. A series of studies demonstrated that recent loss of Arctic sea ice is triggered
by the atmospheric circulation changes such as a tendency toward a dipole pattern in the mean sea level pressure trend
with an increase over the Arctic Ocean and a decrease over Siberia. The Arctic dipole anomaly in summer
(Wang et al., 2009), winter (Watanabe et al., 2006) and spring (Kapsch et al., 2019) produces a strong meridional
wind (v-component) anomaly that drives more sea ice out of the Arctic Ocean. In addition, this dipole anomaly promotes
transport of heat and moisture and thus enhances downward longwave radiation and control the melt onset
(Huang et al., 2019b; Kapsch et al., 2019). Moreover, the changes in cyclone occurrence and/or depth during spring
(Screen et al., 2011) and summer (Simmonds and Rudeva, 2012) have preconditioning effects on the sea ice cover and
exert a strong influence on the amount of sea ice that survives the melt season. A recent study also pointed out that
a stronger anticyclonic circulation over Greenland and the Arctic Ocean in the troposphere may have contributed as much
as 60% to the September sea ice extent decline since 1979, by warming and moistening the lower atmosphere

These conclusions are mainly drawn from in-situ measurements during field campaign (Perovich et al., 2002; Sturm et al.,
2002), global reanalysis products and surface observations (Screen and Simmonds, 2012; Boisvert et al., 2018;
Wang et al., 2019). The higher precipitation and snowfall could result in a thicker snowpack that allows less heat
loss to the atmosphere. More importantly, modeling studies suggest that increases in Arctic precipitation over the
21st century, particularly in late autumn and winter, are due mainly to strongly intensified local surface evaporation
(latent heat flux) (Bintanja and Selten, 2014). Therefore, we believe that Arctic precipitation exerts direct influence
on sea ice variations (arrow i), while sea ice modulates precipitation mainly through sensible plus latent heat flux
(arrows h, b). Among these studies, very few of them have demonstrated the delayed impact of one variable on another.
Specifically, the net shortwave flux at the surface in early summer (Mayâ€“July) is found to enhance sea ice melt with a
lag of 1â€“4 months (Choi et al., 2014). Moreover, the sea ice condition exhibits the delayed impacts on itself, which is
called sea ice anomaly persistence (Guemas et al., 2016; Cruz-GarcÃ­a et al., 2019; Holland et al., 2019). The sea ice
anomaly persistence depends on the predictand (area, extent, volume), region, and the initial and target dates, which
can be varied from a few days to a few years (Guemas et al., 2016). With sea ice anomaly persistence,
there is predictability for the sea ice area in winter but low predictability throughout the rest of the year in
peripheral seas. Based on multiple model simulations, the Labrador Sea stands out among the considered regions,
with sea ice predictability extending up to 1.5 years (Cruz-GarcÃ­a et al., 2019). Note that most of studies mentioned
above determine the changes in one variable, happening before another one, by applying time series analysis and/or
composite analysis based on observations, reanalysis or model output (Perovich et al., 2002; Sturm et al., 2002; Kay
and Gettelman, 2009; Wang et al., 2009; Nussbaumer and Pinker, 2012; Kapsch et al., 2013; Choi et al., 2014; Boisvert

2018; Wang et al., 2019). Among them, some studies use more advanced statistical analysis such as empirical orthogonal
function (Watanabe et al., 2006; Overland and Wang, 2010) and self-organizing map (Kapsch et al., 2019; Rinke et al.,
2019). Other studies assess the causal links through targeted modeling experiments (Bintanja and Selten, 2014; Kapsch
et al., 2016; Ding et al., 2017; Huang et al., 2019a; Cruz-GarcÃ­a et al., 2019), in order to test whether a manipulation
of one variable has an impact on others. And most of the studies focus on relationships between only one or two

(Ding et al., 2017; Huang et al., 2021; Luo et al., 2021). On the other hand, the reduction in Arctic sea ice extent
and increase in open water area in late summer are found to directly contribute to a modification of large-scale

Huang et al. Arctic Sea Ice Causality Discovery circulation patterns in the following autumn through the additional
heat stored in the Arctic Ocean and released to the atmosphere during the autumn (Overland and Wang, 2010). The
increased 1,000â€“500 hPa thickness in autumn produce anomalous easterley zonal wind component (u-component), especially
over the north of Alaska and Canada. Moreover, a more meridional flow pattern associated with sea ice reduction have
an impact on the mid-latitude weather (Overland and Wang, 2010). These conclusions are mainly drawn from model
simulations (Watanabe et al., 2006; Rinke et al., 2019), reanalysis and observations (Wang et al., 2009; Overland and
Wang, 2010; Kapsch et al., 2019). In addition to radiation, the sensible plus latent heat flux also plays an important
role in the Arctic energy budget. The increase in the downward moisture flux triggers the melting of the sea ice in
spring (Boisvert et al., 2015; Boisvert and Stroeve, 2015; Marcovecchio et al., 2021). Earlier melt onset and loss of
sea ice in the spring enhance warming of the ice-free ocean surface, which in turn leads to an increase of evaporation
from the surface into the atmosphere in the autumn. This positive feedback between heat flux and sea ice, indicated
by arrow h, has been confirmed by satellite observations (Boisvert et al., 2015; Boisvert and Stroeve, 2015) and model
simulations (Huang et al., 2019a) during most months of the year. The arrow i represents the influence of precipitation
on Arctic sea ice variations. Specifically, the magnitude of precipitation accumulating over the sea ice pack largely
determines the depth of the snow layer, which modulates the rate of sea ice growth because of its highly insulating
properties (Sturm et al., 2002). The phase of the precipitation falling on the sea ice pack is also important. As rain,
it can melt, compact, and densify the snowpack, thus reducing the surface albedo and promoting sea ice melt (Perovich
et al., 2002).The recent snowfall decline in summer is essentially caused by changes in precipitation form (snow
turning to rain) with very little influence of decreases in total precipitation, which is a result of
lower-atmospheric warming. Then the loss of snow-on-ice results in a substantial decrease in the surface albedo over
the Arctic Ocean, causing additional surface ice melt by absorbing more solar radiation (Screen and Simmonds, 2012).

Huang et al. Arctic Sea Ice Causality Discovery surface. The downward shortwave flux, however, appears only
important after the melt has started (Kapsch et al., 2013; Huang et al., 2017). Once the surface albedo is
significantly reduced due to sea ice melt, the solar radiation could be absorbed by ocean, which further
accelerates ice melt in late spring and summer (Kay and Gettelman, 2009; Choi et al., 2014; Kapsch et al., 2016).
The feedback between surface net shortwave flux and sea ice, represented by arrow f in Figure 1, has been
confirmed by both model simulations (Kapsch et al., 2016) and satellite observations (Kay and Gettelman, 2009;
Nussbaumer and Pinker, 2012; Choi et al., 2014). The arrows g indicate the interactions between the sea ice variations
and atmospheric dynamical processes. A series of studies demonstrated that recent loss of Arctic sea ice is triggered
by the atmospheric circulation changes such as a tendency toward a dipole pattern in the mean sea level pressure trend
with an increase over the Arctic Ocean and a decrease over Siberia. The Arctic dipole anomaly in summer
(Wang et al., 2009), winter (Watanabe et al., 2006) and spring (Kapsch et al., 2019) produces a strong meridional
wind (v-component) anomaly that drives more sea ice out of the Arctic Ocean. In addition, this dipole anomaly promotes
transport of heat and moisture and thus enhances downward longwave radiation and control the melt onset
(Huang et al., 2019b; Kapsch et al., 2019). Moreover, the changes in cyclone occurrence and/or depth during spring
(Screen et al., 2011) and summer (Simmonds and Rudeva, 2012) have preconditioning effects on the sea ice cover and
exert a strong influence on the amount of sea ice that survives the melt season. A recent study also pointed out that
a stronger anticyclonic circulation over Greenland and the Arctic Ocean in the troposphere may have contributed as much
as 60% to the September sea ice extent decline since 1979, by warming and moistening the lower atmosphere

These conclusions are mainly drawn from in-situ measurements during field campaign (Perovich et al., 2002; Sturm et al.,
2002), global reanalysis products and surface observations (Screen and Simmonds, 2012; Boisvert et al., 2018;
Wang et al., 2019). The higher precipitation and snowfall could result in a thicker snowpack that allows less heat
loss to the atmosphere. More importantly, modeling studies suggest that increases in Arctic precipitation over the
21st century, particularly in late autumn and winter, are due mainly to strongly intensified local surface evaporation
(latent heat flux) (Bintanja and Selten, 2014). Therefore, we believe that Arctic precipitation exerts direct influence
on sea ice variations (arrow i), while sea ice modulates precipitation mainly through sensible plus latent heat flux
(arrows h, b). Among these studies, very few of them have demonstrated the delayed impact of one variable on another.
Specifically, the net shortwave flux at the surface in early summer (Mayâ€“July) is found to enhance sea ice melt with a
lag of 1â€“4 months (Choi et al., 2014). Moreover, the sea ice condition exhibits the delayed impacts on itself, which is
called sea ice anomaly persistence (Guemas et al., 2016; Cruz-GarcÃ­a et al., 2019; Holland et al., 2019). The sea ice
anomaly persistence depends on the predictand (area, extent, volume), region, and the initial and target dates, which
can be varied from a few days to a few years (Guemas et al., 2016). With sea ice anomaly persistence,
there is predictability for the sea ice area in winter but low predictability throughout the rest of the year in
peripheral seas. Based on multiple model simulations, the Labrador Sea stands out among the considered regions,
with sea ice predictability extending up to 1.5 years (Cruz-GarcÃ­a et al., 2019). Note that most of studies mentioned
above determine the changes in one variable, happening before another one, by applying time series analysis and/or
composite analysis based on observations, reanalysis or model output (Perovich et al., 2002; Sturm et al., 2002; Kay
and Gettelman, 2009; Wang et al., 2009; Nussbaumer and Pinker, 2012; Kapsch et al., 2013; Choi et al., 2014; Boisvert

2018; Wang et al., 2019). Among them, some studies use more advanced statistical analysis such as empirical orthogonal
function (Watanabe et al., 2006; Overland and Wang, 2010) and self-organizing map (Kapsch et al., 2019; Rinke et al.,
2019). Other studies assess the causal links through targeted modeling experiments (Bintanja and Selten, 2014; Kapsch
et al., 2016; Ding et al., 2017; Huang et al., 2019a; Cruz-GarcÃ­a et al., 2019), in order to test whether a manipulation
of one variable has an impact on others. And most of the studies focus on relationships between only one or two

(Ding et al., 2017; Huang et al., 2021; Luo et al., 2021). On the other hand, the reduction in Arctic sea ice extent
and increase in open water area in late summer are found to directly contribute to a modification of large-scale

Huang et al. Arctic Sea Ice Causality Discovery circulation patterns in the following autumn through the additional
heat stored in the Arctic Ocean and released to the atmosphere during the autumn (Overland and Wang, 2010). The
increased 1,000â€“500 hPa thickness in autumn produce anomalous easterley zonal wind component (u-component), especially
over the north of Alaska and Canada. Moreover, a more meridional flow pattern associated with sea ice reduction have
an impact on the mid-latitude weather (Overland and Wang, 2010). These conclusions are mainly drawn from model
simulations (Watanabe et al., 2006; Rinke et al., 2019), reanalysis and observations (Wang et al., 2009; Overland and
Wang, 2010; Kapsch et al., 2019). In addition to radiation, the sensible plus latent heat flux also plays an important
role in the Arctic energy budget. The increase in the downward moisture flux triggers the melting of the sea ice in
spring (Boisvert et al., 2015; Boisvert and Stroeve, 2015; Marcovecchio et al., 2021). Earlier melt onset and loss of
sea ice in the spring enhance warming of the ice-free ocean surface, which in turn leads to an increase of evaporation
from the surface into the atmosphere in the autumn. This positive feedback between heat flux and sea ice, indicated
by arrow h, has been confirmed by satellite observations (Boisvert et al., 2015; Boisvert and Stroeve, 2015) and model
simulations (Huang et al., 2019a) during most months of the year. The arrow i represents the influence of precipitation
on Arctic sea ice variations. Specifically, the magnitude of precipitation accumulating over the sea ice pack largely
determines the depth of the snow layer, which modulates the rate of sea ice growth because of its highly insulating
properties (Sturm et al., 2002). The phase of the precipitation falling on the sea ice pack is also important. As rain,
it can melt, compact, and densify the snowpack, thus reducing the surface albedo and promoting sea ice melt (Perovich
et al., 2002).The recent snowfall decline in summer is essentially caused by changes in precipitation form (snow
turning to rain) with very little influence of decreases in total precipitation, which is a result of
lower-atmospheric warming. Then the loss of snow-on-ice results in a substantial decrease in the surface albedo over
the Arctic Ocean, causing additional surface ice melt by absorbing more solar radiation (Screen and Simmonds, 2012).

CAUSALITY BETWEEN ATMOSPHERIC PROCESSES AND ARCTIC SEA ICE VARIATIONS
Due to the two-way interactions between the atmosphere and sea ice, studying causality between them is a challenging but
important task, which makes it an area of high interest within polar climate community. The sea ice variations can be
caused by different dynamical and thermodynamical processes. Important dynamical processes include anomalous surface
wind (Spreen et al., 2011; Wu et al., 2012), regional atmospheric circulation patterns (Overland and Wang, 2010;
Screen et al., 2018; Rinke et al., 2019) and abnormal storm activities (Simmonds et al., 2008; Simmonds and Keay, 2009;
Screen et al., 2011; Simmonds and Rudeva, 2012; Parkinson and Comiso, 2013; Simmonds and Rudeva, 2014). Cloud (Kapsch
et al., 2013), radiation (Kay and Gettelman, 2009; Choi et al., 2014) and precipitation (Boisvert et al., 2018; Wang
et al., 2019; Marcovecchio et al., 2021) are the important thermodynamic factors controlling Arctic sea ice trends
and variability. On the other hand, sea ice decline in turn exerts large influence on the atmosphere, including
cloud (Kay and Gettelman, 2009; Morrison et al., 2018), surface energy budget (Semmler et al., 2012; Boisvert et al.,
2015; Boisvert and Stroeve, 2015), precipitation (Bintanja and Selten, 2014; Kopec et al., 2016) and large-scale
circulation (Chemke et al., 2019; Kennel and Yulaeva, 2020). Figure 1 depicts the causal relations between key
atmospheric variables and sea ice over the Arctic. The sea ice here represents sea ice coverage and/or sea ice
thickness. Note that the processes a âˆ’ d are well-known atmospheric processes, including cloud microphysics,
thermodynamics, radiation, climate dynamics, which have been studied over the past few decades. The processes
e âˆ’ i are summarized from more recent publications, which are still under investigation by climate scientists.
We will explain processes e âˆ’ i in details in the next paragraph. The arrow e represents the two-way effect between
sea ice and net longwave flux at the surface. Based on global reanalysis (Kapsch et al., 2013; Lee et al., 2017),
surface (Cox et al., 2016) and satellite observations (Huang et al., 2017), as well as model simulations (Kapsch et
al., 2016; Huang et al., 2019a), the downward longwave radiation at the surface dominates surface warming and
therefore enhances sea ice melt in winter and spring. The increase in downward longwave flux is a result of an
increase in cloudiness and moisture in the Arctic Basin, which is caused by enhanced local evaporation or moisture
transport from mid-latitudes (Luo et al., 2017). Positive anomalies of longwave flux in spring and early summer
initiate an earlier melt onset, thereby triggering several feedback mechanisms which amplify melt during the
succeeding months (Kapsch et al., 2016; Huang et al., 2019b). The sea ice melt increases the air temperature

atmospheric processes with changes in Arctic sea ice. Therefore, in this study, we target to provide a more
comprehensive analysis about causality between multiple atmospheric processes and sea ice by applying different
data-driven causality approaches.

(Huang et al., 2019b; Kapsch et al., 2019). Moreover, the changes in cyclone occurrence and/or depth during spring
(Screen et al., 2011) and summer (Simmonds and Rudeva, 2012) have preconditioning effects on the sea ice cover and
exert a strong influence on the amount of sea ice that survives the melt season. A recent study also pointed out that
a stronger anticyclonic circulation over Greenland and the Arctic Ocean in the troposphere may have contributed as much
as 60% to the September sea ice extent decline since 1979, by warming and moistening the lower atmosphere

These conclusions are mainly drawn from in-situ measurements during field campaign (Perovich et al., 2002; Sturm et al.,
2002), global reanalysis products and surface observations (Screen and Simmonds, 2012; Boisvert et al., 2018;
Wang et al., 2019). The higher precipitation and snowfall could result in a thicker snowpack that allows less heat
loss to the atmosphere. More importantly, modeling studies suggest that increases in Arctic precipitation over the
21st century, particularly in late autumn and winter, are due mainly to strongly intensified local surface evaporation
(latent heat flux) (Bintanja and Selten, 2014). Therefore, we believe that Arctic precipitation exerts direct influence
on sea ice variations (arrow i), while sea ice modulates precipitation mainly through sensible plus latent heat flux
(arrows h, b). Among these studies, very few of them have demonstrated the delayed impact of one variable on another.
Specifically, the net shortwave flux at the surface in early summer (Mayâ€“July) is found to enhance sea ice melt with a
lag of 1â€“4 months (Choi et al., 2014). Moreover, the sea ice condition exhibits the delayed impacts on itself, which is
called sea ice anomaly persistence (Guemas et al., 2016; Cruz-GarcÃ­a et al., 2019; Holland et al., 2019). The sea ice
anomaly persistence depends on the predictand (area, extent, volume), region, and the initial and target dates, which
can be varied from a few days to a few years (Guemas et al., 2016). With sea ice anomaly persistence,
there is predictability for the sea ice area in winter but low predictability throughout the rest of the year in
peripheral seas. Based on multiple model simulations, the Labrador Sea stands out among the considered regions,
with sea ice predictability extending up to 1.5 years (Cruz-GarcÃ­a et al., 2019). Note that most of studies mentioned
above determine the changes in one variable, happening before another one, by applying time series analysis and/or
composite analysis based on observations, reanalysis or model output (Perovich et al., 2002; Sturm et al., 2002; Kay
and Gettelman, 2009; Wang et al., 2009; Nussbaumer and Pinker, 2012; Kapsch et al., 2013; Choi et al., 2014; Boisvert
et al., 2015; Boisvert and Stroeve, 2015; Cox et al., 2016; Huang et al., 2017; Huang et al., 2019b; Boisvert et al.,
2018; Wang et al., 2019). Among them, some studies use more advanced statistical analysis such as empirical orthogonal
function (Watanabe et al., 2006; Overland and Wang, 2010) and self-organizing map (Kapsch et al., 2019; Rinke et al.,
2019). Other studies assess the causal links through targeted modeling experiments (Bintanja and Selten, 2014; Kapsch
et al., 2016; Ding et al., 2017; Huang et al., 2019a; Cruz-GarcÃ­a et al., 2019), in order to test whether a manipulation
of one variable has an impact on others. And most of the studies focus on relationships between only one or two

(Ding et al., 2017; Huang et al., 2021; Luo et al., 2021). On the other hand, the reduction in Arctic sea ice extent
and increase in open water area in late summer are found to directly contribute to a modification of large-scale

Huang et al. Arctic Sea Ice Causality Discovery circulation patterns in the following autumn through the additional
heat stored in the Arctic Ocean and released to the atmosphere during the autumn (Overland and Wang, 2010). The
increased 1,000â€“500 hPa thickness in autumn produce anomalous easterley zonal wind component (u-component), especially
over the north of Alaska and Canada. Moreover, a more meridional flow pattern associated with sea ice reduction have
an impact on the mid-latitude weather (Overland and Wang, 2010). These conclusions are mainly drawn from model
simulations (Watanabe et al., 2006; Rinke et al., 2019), reanalysis and observations (Wang et al., 2009; Overland and
Wang, 2010; Kapsch et al., 2019). In addition to radiation, the sensible plus latent heat flux also plays an important
role in the Arctic energy budget. The increase in the downward moisture flux triggers the melting of the sea ice in
spring (Boisvert et al., 2015; Boisvert and Stroeve, 2015; Marcovecchio et al., 2021). Earlier melt onset and loss of
sea ice in the spring enhance warming of the ice-free ocean surface, which in turn leads to an increase of evaporation
from the surface into the atmosphere in the autumn. This positive feedback between heat flux and sea ice, indicated
by arrow h, has been confirmed by satellite observations (Boisvert et al., 2015; Boisvert and Stroeve, 2015) and model
simulations (Huang et al., 2019a) during most months of the year. The arrow i represents the influence of precipitation
on Arctic sea ice variations. Specifically, the magnitude of precipitation accumulating over the sea ice pack largely
determines the depth of the snow layer, which modulates the rate of sea ice growth because of its highly insulating
properties (Sturm et al., 2002). The phase of the precipitation falling on the sea ice pack is also important. As rain,
it can melt, compact, and densify the snowpack, thus reducing the surface albedo and promoting sea ice melt (Perovich
et al., 2002).The recent snowfall decline in summer is essentially caused by changes in precipitation form (snow
turning to rain) with very little influence of decreases in total precipitation, which is a result of
lower-atmospheric warming. Then the loss of snow-on-ice results in a substantial decrease in the surface albedo over
the Arctic Ocean, causing additional surface ice melt by absorbing more solar radiation (Screen and Simmonds, 2012).

CAUSALITY BETWEEN ATMOSPHERIC PROCESSES AND ARCTIC SEA ICE VARIATIONS
Due to the two-way interactions between the atmosphere and sea ice, studying causality between them is a challenging but
important task, which makes it an area of high interest within polar climate community. The sea ice variations can be
caused by different dynamical and thermodynamical processes. Important dynamical processes include anomalous surface
wind (Spreen et al., 2011; Wu et al., 2012), regional atmospheric circulation patterns (Overland and Wang, 2010;
Screen et al., 2018; Rinke et al., 2019) and abnormal storm activities (Simmonds et al., 2008; Simmonds and Keay, 2009;
Screen et al., 2011; Simmonds and Rudeva, 2012; Parkinson and Comiso, 2013; Simmonds and Rudeva, 2014). Cloud (Kapsch
et al., 2013), radiation (Kay and Gettelman, 2009; Choi et al., 2014) and precipitation (Boisvert et al., 2018; Wang
et al., 2019; Marcovecchio et al., 2021) are the important thermodynamic factors controlling Arctic sea ice trends
and variability. On the other hand, sea ice decline in turn exerts large influence on the atmosphere, including
cloud (Kay and Gettelman, 2009; Morrison et al., 2018), surface energy budget (Semmler et al., 2012; Boisvert et al.,
2015; Boisvert and Stroeve, 2015), precipitation (Bintanja and Selten, 2014; Kopec et al., 2016) and large-scale
circulation (Chemke et al., 2019; Kennel and Yulaeva, 2020). Figure 1 depicts the causal relations between key
atmospheric variables and sea ice over the Arctic. The sea ice here represents sea ice coverage and/or sea ice
thickness. Note that the processes a âˆ’ d are well-known atmospheric processes, including cloud microphysics,
thermodynamics, radiation, climate dynamics, which have been studied over the past few decades. The processes
e âˆ’ i are summarized from more recent publications, which are still under investigation by climate scientists.
We will explain processes e âˆ’ i in details in the next paragraph. The arrow e represents the two-way effect between
sea ice and net longwave flux at the surface. Based on global reanalysis (Kapsch et al., 2013; Lee et al., 2017),
surface (Cox et al., 2016) and satellite observations (Huang et al., 2017), as well as model simulations (Kapsch et
al., 2016; Huang et al., 2019a), the downward longwave radiation at the surface dominates surface warming and
therefore enhances sea ice melt in winter and spring. The increase in downward longwave flux is a result of an
increase in cloudiness and moisture in the Arctic Basin, which is caused by enhanced local evaporation or moisture
transport from mid-latitudes (Luo et al., 2017). Positive anomalies of longwave flux in spring and early summer
initiate an earlier melt onset, thereby triggering several feedback mechanisms which amplify melt during the
succeeding months (Kapsch et al., 2016; Huang et al., 2019b). The sea ice melt increases the air temperature

atmospheric processes with changes in Arctic sea ice. Therefore, in this study, we target to provide a more
comprehensive analysis about causality between multiple atmospheric processes and sea ice by applying different
data-driven causality approaches.

Huang et al. Arctic Sea Ice Causality Discovery surface. The downward shortwave flux, however, appears only
important after the melt has started (Kapsch et al., 2013; Huang et al., 2017). Once the surface albedo is
significantly reduced due to sea ice melt, the solar radiation could be absorbed by ocean, which further
accelerates ice melt in late spring and summer (Kay and Gettelman, 2009; Choi et al., 2014; Kapsch et al., 2016).
The feedback between surface net shortwave flux and sea ice, represented by arrow f in Figure 1, has been
confirmed by both model simulations (Kapsch et al., 2016) and satellite observations (Kay and Gettelman, 2009;
Nussbaumer and Pinker, 2012; Choi et al., 2014). The arrows g indicate the interactions between the sea ice variations
and atmospheric dynamical processes. A series of studies demonstrated that recent loss of Arctic sea ice is triggered
by the atmospheric circulation changes such as a tendency toward a dipole pattern in the mean sea level pressure trend
with an increase over the Arctic Ocean and a decrease over Siberia. The Arctic dipole anomaly in summer
(Wang et al., 2009), winter (Watanabe et al., 2006) and spring (Kapsch et al., 2019) produces a strong meridional
wind (v-component) anomaly that drives more sea ice out of the Arctic Ocean. In addition, this dipole anomaly promotes

Huang et al. Arctic Sea Ice Causality Discovery circulation patterns in the following autumn through the additional
heat stored in the Arctic Ocean and released to the atmosphere during the autumn (Overland and Wang, 2010). The
increased 1,000â€“500 hPa thickness in autumn produce anomalous easterley zonal wind component (u-component), especially
over the north of Alaska and Canada. Moreover, a more meridional flow pattern associated with sea ice reduction have
an impact on the mid-latitude weather (Overland and Wang, 2010). These conclusions are mainly drawn from model
simulations (Watanabe et al., 2006; Rinke et al., 2019), reanalysis and observations (Wang et al., 2009; Overland and
Wang, 2010; Kapsch et al., 2019). In addition to radiation, the sensible plus latent heat flux also plays an important
role in the Arctic energy budget. The increase in the downward moisture flux triggers the melting of the sea ice in
spring (Boisvert et al., 2015; Boisvert and Stroeve, 2015; Marcovecchio et al., 2021). Earlier melt onset and loss of
sea ice in the spring enhance warming of the ice-free ocean surface, which in turn leads to an increase of evaporation
from the surface into the atmosphere in the autumn. This positive feedback between heat flux and sea ice, indicated
by arrow h, has been confirmed by satellite observations (Boisvert et al., 2015; Boisvert and Stroeve, 2015) and model
simulations (Huang et al., 2019a) during most months of the year. The arrow i represents the influence of precipitation
on Arctic sea ice variations. Specifically, the magnitude of precipitation accumulating over the sea ice pack largely
determines the depth of the snow layer, which modulates the rate of sea ice growth because of its highly insulating
properties (Sturm et al., 2002). The phase of the precipitation falling on the sea ice pack is also important. As rain,
it can melt, compact, and densify the snowpack, thus reducing the surface albedo and promoting sea ice melt (Perovich
et al., 2002).The recent snowfall decline in summer is essentially caused by changes in precipitation form (snow
turning to rain) with very little influence of decreases in total precipitation, which is a result of
lower-atmospheric warming. Then the loss of snow-on-ice results in a substantial decrease in the surface albedo over
the Arctic Ocean, causing additional surface ice melt by absorbing more solar radiation (Screen and Simmonds, 2012).

CAUSALITY BETWEEN ATMOSPHERIC PROCESSES AND ARCTIC SEA ICE VARIATIONS
Due to the two-way interactions between the atmosphere and sea ice, studying causality between them is a challenging but
important task, which makes it an area of high interest within polar climate community. The sea ice variations can be
caused by different dynamical and thermodynamical processes. Important dynamical processes include anomalous surface
wind (Spreen et al., 2011; Wu et al., 2012), regional atmospheric circulation patterns (Overland and Wang, 2010;
Screen et al., 2018; Rinke et al., 2019) and abnormal storm activities (Simmonds et al., 2008; Simmonds and Keay, 2009;
Screen et al., 2011; Simmonds and Rudeva, 2012; Parkinson and Comiso, 2013; Simmonds and Rudeva, 2014). Cloud (Kapsch
et al., 2013), radiation (Kay and Gettelman, 2009; Choi et al., 2014) and precipitation (Boisvert et al., 2018; Wang
et al., 2019; Marcovecchio et al., 2021) are the important thermodynamic factors controlling Arctic sea ice trends
and variability. On the other hand, sea ice decline in turn exerts large influence on the atmosphere, including
cloud (Kay and Gettelman, 2009; Morrison et al., 2018), surface energy budget (Semmler et al., 2012; Boisvert et al.,
2015; Boisvert and Stroeve, 2015), precipitation (Bintanja and Selten, 2014; Kopec et al., 2016) and large-scale
circulation (Chemke et al., 2019; Kennel and Yulaeva, 2020). Figure 1 depicts the causal relations between key
atmospheric variables and sea ice over the Arctic. The sea ice here represents sea ice coverage and/or sea ice
thickness. Note that the processes a âˆ’ d are well-known atmospheric processes, including cloud microphysics,
thermodynamics, radiation, climate dynamics, which have been studied over the past few decades. The processes
e âˆ’ i are summarized from more recent publications, which are still under investigation by climate scientists.
We will explain processes e âˆ’ i in details in the next paragraph. The arrow e represents the two-way effect between
sea ice and net longwave flux at the surface. Based on global reanalysis (Kapsch et al., 2013; Lee et al., 2017),
surface (Cox et al., 2016) and satellite observations (Huang et al., 2017), as well as model simulations (Kapsch et
al., 2016; Huang et al., 2019a), the downward longwave radiation at the surface dominates surface warming and
therefore enhances sea ice melt in winter and spring. The increase in downward longwave flux is a result of an
increase in cloudiness and moisture in the Arctic Basin, which is caused by enhanced local evaporation or moisture
transport from mid-latitudes (Luo et al., 2017). Positive anomalies of longwave flux in spring and early summer
initiate an earlier melt onset, thereby triggering several feedback mechanisms which amplify melt during the
succeeding months (Kapsch et al., 2016; Huang et al., 2019b). The sea ice melt increases the air temperature

atmospheric processes with changes in Arctic sea ice. Therefore, in this study, we target to provide a more
comprehensive analysis about causality between multiple atmospheric processes and sea ice by applying different
data-driven causality approaches.

Huang et al. Arctic Sea Ice Causality Discovery surface. The downward shortwave flux, however, appears only
important after the melt has started (Kapsch et al., 2013; Huang et al., 2017). Once the surface albedo is
significantly reduced due to sea ice melt, the solar radiation could be absorbed by ocean, which further
accelerates ice melt in late spring and summer (Kay and Gettelman, 2009; Choi et al., 2014; Kapsch et al., 2016).
The feedback between surface net shortwave flux and sea ice, represented by arrow f in Figure 1, has been
confirmed by both model simulations (Kapsch et al., 2016) and satellite observations (Kay and Gettelman, 2009;
Nussbaumer and Pinker, 2012; Choi et al., 2014). The arrows g indicate the interactions between the sea ice variations
and atmospheric dynamical processes. A series of studies demonstrated that recent loss of Arctic sea ice is triggered
by the atmospheric circulation changes such as a tendency toward a dipole pattern in the mean sea level pressure trend
with an increase over the Arctic Ocean and a decrease over Siberia. The Arctic dipole anomaly in summer
(Wang et al., 2009), winter (Watanabe et al., 2006) and spring (Kapsch et al., 2019) produces a strong meridional
wind (v-component) anomaly that drives more sea ice out of the Arctic Ocean. In addition, this dipole anomaly promotes
transport of heat and moisture and thus enhances downward longwave radiation and control the melt onset
(Huang et al., 2019b; Kapsch et al., 2019). Moreover, the changes in cyclone occurrence and/or depth during spring
(Screen et al., 2011) and summer (Simmonds and Rudeva, 2012) have preconditioning effects on the sea ice cover and
exert a strong influence on the amount of sea ice that survives the melt season. A recent study also pointed out that
a stronger anticyclonic circulation over Greenland and the Arctic Ocean in the troposphere may have contributed as much
as 60% to the September sea ice extent decline since 1979, by warming and moistening the lower atmosphere

These conclusions are mainly drawn from in-situ measurements during field campaign (Perovich et al., 2002; Sturm et al.,
2002), global reanalysis products and surface observations (Screen and Simmonds, 2012; Boisvert et al., 2018;
Wang et al., 2019). The higher precipitation and snowfall could result in a thicker snowpack that allows less heat
loss to the atmosphere. More importantly, modeling studies suggest that increases in Arctic precipitation over the
21st century, particularly in late autumn and winter, are due mainly to strongly intensified local surface evaporation
(latent heat flux) (Bintanja and Selten, 2014). Therefore, we believe that Arctic precipitation exerts direct influence
on sea ice variations (arrow i), while sea ice modulates precipitation mainly through sensible plus latent heat flux
(arrows h, b). Among these studies, very few of them have demonstrated the delayed impact of one variable on another.
Specifically, the net shortwave flux at the surface in early summer (Mayâ€“July) is found to enhance sea ice melt with a
lag of 1â€“4 months (Choi et al., 2014). Moreover, the sea ice condition exhibits the delayed impacts on itself, which is
called sea ice anomaly persistence (Guemas et al., 2016; Cruz-GarcÃ­a et al., 2019; Holland et al., 2019). The sea ice
anomaly persistence depends on the predictand (area, extent, volume), region, and the initial and target dates, which
can be varied from a few days to a few years (Guemas et al., 2016). With sea ice anomaly persistence,
there is predictability for the sea ice area in winter but low predictability throughout the rest of the year in
peripheral seas. Based on multiple model simulations, the Labrador Sea stands out among the considered regions,
with sea ice predictability extending up to 1.5 years (Cruz-GarcÃ­a et al., 2019). Note that most of studies mentioned
above determine the changes in one variable, happening before another one, by applying time series analysis and/or
composite analysis based on observations, reanalysis or model output (Perovich et al., 2002; Sturm et al., 2002; Kay
and Gettelman, 2009; Wang et al., 2009; Nussbaumer and Pinker, 2012; Kapsch et al., 2013; Choi et al., 2014; Boisvert

2018; Wang et al., 2019). Among them, some studies use more advanced statistical analysis such as empirical orthogonal
function (Watanabe et al., 2006; Overland and Wang, 2010) and self-organizing map (Kapsch et al., 2019; Rinke et al.,
2019). Other studies assess the causal links through targeted modeling experiments (Bintanja and Selten, 2014; Kapsch
et al., 2016; Ding et al., 2017; Huang et al., 2019a; Cruz-GarcÃ­a et al., 2019), in order to test whether a manipulation

and variability. On the other hand, sea ice decline in turn exerts large influence on the atmosphere, including
cloud (Kay and Gettelman, 2009; Morrison et al., 2018), surface energy budget (Semmler et al., 2012; Boisvert et al.,

surface (Cox et al., 2016) and satellite observations (Huang et al., 2017), as well as model simulations (Kapsch et
al., 2016; Huang et al., 2019a), the downward longwave radiation at the surface dominates surface warming and
therefore enhances sea ice melt in winter and spring. The increase in downward longwave flux is a result of an
increase in cloudiness and moisture in the Arctic Basin, which is caused by enhanced local evaporation or moisture
transport from mid-latitudes (Luo et al., 2017). Positive anomalies of longwave flux in spring and early summer
initiate an earlier melt onset, thereby triggering several feedback mechanisms which amplify melt during the
succeeding months (Kapsch et al., 2016; Huang et al., 2019b). The sea ice melt increases the air temperature

Huang et al. Arctic Sea Ice Causality Discovery surface. The downward shortwave flux, however, appears only
important after the melt has started (Kapsch et al., 2013; Huang et al., 2017). Once the surface albedo is
significantly reduced due to sea ice melt, the solar radiation could be absorbed by ocean, which further
accelerates ice melt in late spring and summer (Kay and Gettelman, 2009; Choi et al., 2014; Kapsch et al., 2016).
The feedback between surface net shortwave flux and sea ice, represented by arrow f in Figure 1, has been
confirmed by both model simulations (Kapsch et al., 2016) and satellite observations (Kay and Gettelman, 2009;
Nussbaumer and Pinker, 2012; Choi et al., 2014). The arrows g indicate the interactions between the sea ice variations
and atmospheric dynamical processes. A series of studies demonstrated that recent loss of Arctic sea ice is triggered
by the atmospheric circulation changes such as a tendency toward a dipole pattern in the mean sea level pressure trend
with an increase over the Arctic Ocean and a decrease over Siberia. The Arctic dipole anomaly in summer
(Wang et al., 2009), winter (Watanabe et al., 2006) and spring (Kapsch et al., 2019) produces a strong meridional
wind (v-component) anomaly that drives more sea ice out of the Arctic Ocean. In addition, this dipole anomaly promotes
transport of heat and moisture and thus enhances downward longwave radiation and control the melt onset
(Huang et al., 2019b; Kapsch et al., 2019). Moreover, the changes in cyclone occurrence and/or depth during spring
(Screen et al., 2011) and summer (Simmonds and Rudeva, 2012) have preconditioning effects on the sea ice cover and
exert a strong influence on the amount of sea ice that survives the melt season. A recent study also pointed out that
a stronger anticyclonic circulation over Greenland and the Arctic Ocean in the troposphere may have contributed as much
as 60% to the September sea ice extent decline since 1979, by warming and moistening the lower atmosphere

These conclusions are mainly drawn from in-situ measurements during field campaign (Perovich et al., 2002; Sturm et al.,
2002), global reanalysis products and surface observations (Screen and Simmonds, 2012; Boisvert et al., 2018;
Wang et al., 2019). The higher precipitation and snowfall could result in a thicker snowpack that allows less heat
loss to the atmosphere. More importantly, modeling studies suggest that increases in Arctic precipitation over the
21st century, particularly in late autumn and winter, are due mainly to strongly intensified local surface evaporation
(latent heat flux) (Bintanja and Selten, 2014). Therefore, we believe that Arctic precipitation exerts direct influence
on sea ice variations (arrow i), while sea ice modulates precipitation mainly through sensible plus latent heat flux
(arrows h, b). Among these studies, very few of them have demonstrated the delayed impact of one variable on another.
Specifically, the net shortwave flux at the surface in early summer (Mayâ€“July) is found to enhance sea ice melt with a
lag of 1â€“4 months (Choi et al., 2014). Moreover, the sea ice condition exhibits the delayed impacts on itself, which is
called sea ice anomaly persistence (Guemas et al., 2016; Cruz-GarcÃ­a et al., 2019; Holland et al., 2019). The sea ice
anomaly persistence depends on the predictand (area, extent, volume), region, and the initial and target dates, which
can be varied from a few days to a few years (Guemas et al., 2016). With sea ice anomaly persistence,
there is predictability for the sea ice area in winter but low predictability throughout the rest of the year in
peripheral seas. Based on multiple model simulations, the Labrador Sea stands out among the considered regions,
with sea ice predictability extending up to 1.5 years (Cruz-GarcÃ­a et al., 2019). Note that most of studies mentioned
above determine the changes in one variable, happening before another one, by applying time series analysis and/or
composite analysis based on observations, reanalysis or model output (Perovich et al., 2002; Sturm et al., 2002; Kay
and Gettelman, 2009; Wang et al., 2009; Nussbaumer and Pinker, 2012; Kapsch et al., 2013; Choi et al., 2014; Boisvert

2018; Wang et al., 2019). Among them, some studies use more advanced statistical analysis such as empirical orthogonal
function (Watanabe et al., 2006; Overland and Wang, 2010) and self-organizing map (Kapsch et al., 2019; Rinke et al.,
2019). Other studies assess the causal links through targeted modeling experiments (Bintanja and Selten, 2014; Kapsch
et al., 2016; Ding et al., 2017; Huang et al., 2019a; Cruz-GarcÃ­a et al., 2019), in order to test whether a manipulation
of one variable has an impact on others. And most of the studies focus on relationships between only one or two

(Ding et al., 2017; Huang et al., 2021; Luo et al., 2021). On the other hand, the reduction in Arctic sea ice extent
and increase in open water area in late summer are found to directly contribute to a modification of large-scale

Huang et al. Arctic Sea Ice Causality Discovery circulation patterns in the following autumn through the additional
heat stored in the Arctic Ocean and released to the atmosphere during the autumn (Overland and Wang, 2010). The
increased 1,000â€“500 hPa thickness in autumn produce anomalous easterley zonal wind component (u-component), especially
over the north of Alaska and Canada. Moreover, a more meridional flow pattern associated with sea ice reduction have
an impact on the mid-latitude weather (Overland and Wang, 2010). These conclusions are mainly drawn from model
simulations (Watanabe et al., 2006; Rinke et al., 2019), reanalysis and observations (Wang et al., 2009; Overland and
Wang, 2010; Kapsch et al., 2019). In addition to radiation, the sensible plus latent heat flux also plays an important
role in the Arctic energy budget. The increase in the downward moisture flux triggers the melting of the sea ice in
spring (Boisvert et al., 2015; Boisvert and Stroeve, 2015; Marcovecchio et al., 2021). Earlier melt onset and loss of
sea ice in the spring enhance warming of the ice-free ocean surface, which in turn leads to an increase of evaporation
from the surface into the atmosphere in the autumn. This positive feedback between heat flux and sea ice, indicated
by arrow h, has been confirmed by satellite observations (Boisvert et al., 2015; Boisvert and Stroeve, 2015) and model
simulations (Huang et al., 2019a) during most months of the year. The arrow i represents the influence of precipitation
on Arctic sea ice variations. Specifically, the magnitude of precipitation accumulating over the sea ice pack largely
determines the depth of the snow layer, which modulates the rate of sea ice growth because of its highly insulating
properties (Sturm et al., 2002). The phase of the precipitation falling on the sea ice pack is also important. As rain,
it can melt, compact, and densify the snowpack, thus reducing the surface albedo and promoting sea ice melt (Perovich
et al., 2002).The recent snowfall decline in summer is essentially caused by changes in precipitation form (snow
turning to rain) with very little influence of decreases in total precipitation, which is a result of
lower-atmospheric warming. Then the loss of snow-on-ice results in a substantial decrease in the surface albedo over
the Arctic Ocean, causing additional surface ice melt by absorbing more solar radiation (Screen and Simmonds, 2012).

CAUSALITY BETWEEN ATMOSPHERIC PROCESSES AND ARCTIC SEA ICE VARIATIONS
Due to the two-way interactions between the atmosphere and sea ice, studying causality between them is a challenging but
important task, which makes it an area of high interest within polar climate community. The sea ice variations can be
caused by different dynamical and thermodynamical processes. Important dynamical processes include anomalous surface
wind (Spreen et al., 2011; Wu et al., 2012), regional atmospheric circulation patterns (Overland and Wang, 2010;
Screen et al., 2018; Rinke et al., 2019) and abnormal storm activities (Simmonds et al., 2008; Simmonds and Keay, 2009;

et al., 2019; Marcovecchio et al., 2021) are the important thermodynamic factors controlling Arctic sea ice trends

Huang et al. Arctic Sea Ice Causality Discovery surface. The downward shortwave flux, however, appears only
important after the melt has started (Kapsch et al., 2013; Huang et al., 2017). Once the surface albedo is
significantly reduced due to sea ice melt, the solar radiation could be absorbed by ocean, which further
accelerates ice melt in late spring and summer (Kay and Gettelman, 2009; Choi et al., 2014; Kapsch et al., 2016).
The feedback between surface net shortwave flux and sea ice, represented by arrow f in Figure 1, has been
confirmed by both model simulations (Kapsch et al., 2016) and satellite observations (Kay and Gettelman, 2009;
Nussbaumer and Pinker, 2012; Choi et al., 2014). The arrows g indicate the interactions between the sea ice variations
and atmospheric dynamical processes. A series of studies demonstrated that recent loss of Arctic sea ice is triggered
by the atmospheric circulation changes such as a tendency toward a dipole pattern in the mean sea level pressure trend
with an increase over the Arctic Ocean and a decrease over Siberia. The Arctic dipole anomaly in summer
(Wang et al., 2009), winter (Watanabe et al., 2006) and spring (Kapsch et al., 2019) produces a strong meridional
wind (v-component) anomaly that drives more sea ice out of the Arctic Ocean. In addition, this dipole anomaly promotes
transport of heat and moisture and thus enhances downward longwave radiation and control the melt onset
(Huang et al., 2019b; Kapsch et al., 2019). Moreover, the changes in cyclone occurrence and/or depth during spring
(Screen et al., 2011) and summer (Simmonds and Rudeva, 2012) have preconditioning effects on the sea ice cover and
exert a strong influence on the amount of sea ice that survives the melt season. A recent study also pointed out that
a stronger anticyclonic circulation over Greenland and the Arctic Ocean in the troposphere may have contributed as much
as 60% to the September sea ice extent decline since 1979, by warming and moistening the lower atmosphere

These conclusions are mainly drawn from in-situ measurements during field campaign (Perovich et al., 2002; Sturm et al.,
2002), global reanalysis products and surface observations (Screen and Simmonds, 2012; Boisvert et al., 2018;
Wang et al., 2019). The higher precipitation and snowfall could result in a thicker snowpack that allows less heat
loss to the atmosphere. More importantly, modeling studies suggest that increases in Arctic precipitation over the
21st century, particularly in late autumn and winter, are due mainly to strongly intensified local surface evaporation
(latent heat flux) (Bintanja and Selten, 2014). Therefore, we believe that Arctic precipitation exerts direct influence
on sea ice variations (arrow i), while sea ice modulates precipitation mainly through sensible plus latent heat flux
(arrows h, b). Among these studies, very few of them have demonstrated the delayed impact of one variable on another.
Specifically, the net shortwave flux at the surface in early summer (Mayâ€“July) is found to enhance sea ice melt with a
lag of 1â€“4 months (Choi et al., 2014). Moreover, the sea ice condition exhibits the delayed impacts on itself, which is
called sea ice anomaly persistence (Guemas et al., 2016; Cruz-GarcÃ­a et al., 2019; Holland et al., 2019). The sea ice
anomaly persistence depends on the predictand (area, extent, volume), region, and the initial and target dates, which
can be varied from a few days to a few years (Guemas et al., 2016). With sea ice anomaly persistence,
there is predictability for the sea ice area in winter but low predictability throughout the rest of the year in
peripheral seas. Based on multiple model simulations, the Labrador Sea stands out among the considered regions,
with sea ice predictability extending up to 1.5 years (Cruz-GarcÃ­a et al., 2019). Note that most of studies mentioned
above determine the changes in one variable, happening before another one, by applying time series analysis and/or
composite analysis based on observations, reanalysis or model output (Perovich et al., 2002; Sturm et al., 2002; Kay
and Gettelman, 2009; Wang et al., 2009; Nussbaumer and Pinker, 2012; Kapsch et al., 2013; Choi et al., 2014; Boisvert

2018; Wang et al., 2019). Among them, some studies use more advanced statistical analysis such as empirical orthogonal
function (Watanabe et al., 2006; Overland and Wang, 2010) and self-organizing map (Kapsch et al., 2019; Rinke et al.,
2019). Other studies assess the causal links through targeted modeling experiments (Bintanja and Selten, 2014; Kapsch
et al., 2016; Ding et al., 2017; Huang et al., 2019a; Cruz-GarcÃ­a et al., 2019), in order to test whether a manipulation
of one variable has an impact on others. And most of the studies focus on relationships between only one or two

(Ding et al., 2017; Huang et al., 2021; Luo et al., 2021). On the other hand, the reduction in Arctic sea ice extent
and increase in open water area in late summer are found to directly contribute to a modification of large-scale

Huang et al. Arctic Sea Ice Causality Discovery circulation patterns in the following autumn through the additional
heat stored in the Arctic Ocean and released to the atmosphere during the autumn (Overland and Wang, 2010). The
increased 1,000â€“500 hPa thickness in autumn produce anomalous easterley zonal wind component (u-component), especially
over the north of Alaska and Canada. Moreover, a more meridional flow pattern associated with sea ice reduction have
an impact on the mid-latitude weather (Overland and Wang, 2010). These conclusions are mainly drawn from model
simulations (Watanabe et al., 2006; Rinke et al., 2019), reanalysis and observations (Wang et al., 2009; Overland and
Wang, 2010; Kapsch et al., 2019). In addition to radiation, the sensible plus latent heat flux also plays an important
role in the Arctic energy budget. The increase in the downward moisture flux triggers the melting of the sea ice in
spring (Boisvert et al., 2015; Boisvert and Stroeve, 2015; Marcovecchio et al., 2021). Earlier melt onset and loss of
sea ice in the spring enhance warming of the ice-free ocean surface, which in turn leads to an increase of evaporation
from the surface into the atmosphere in the autumn. This positive feedback between heat flux and sea ice, indicated
by arrow h, has been confirmed by satellite observations (Boisvert et al., 2015; Boisvert and Stroeve, 2015) and model
simulations (Huang et al., 2019a) during most months of the year. The arrow i represents the influence of precipitation
on Arctic sea ice variations. Specifically, the magnitude of precipitation accumulating over the sea ice pack largely
determines the depth of the snow layer, which modulates the rate of sea ice growth because of its highly insulating
properties (Sturm et al., 2002). The phase of the precipitation falling on the sea ice pack is also important. As rain,
it can melt, compact, and densify the snowpack, thus reducing the surface albedo and promoting sea ice melt (Perovich
et al., 2002).The recent snowfall decline in summer is essentially caused by changes in precipitation form (snow
turning to rain) with very little influence of decreases in total precipitation, which is a result of
lower-atmospheric warming. Then the loss of snow-on-ice results in a substantial decrease in the surface albedo over
the Arctic Ocean, causing additional surface ice melt by absorbing more solar radiation (Screen and Simmonds, 2012).

CAUSALITY BETWEEN ATMOSPHERIC PROCESSES AND ARCTIC SEA ICE VARIATIONS
Due to the two-way interactions between the atmosphere and sea ice, studying causality between them is a challenging but
important task, which makes it an area of high interest within polar climate community. The sea ice variations can be
caused by different dynamical and thermodynamical processes. Important dynamical processes include anomalous surface
wind (Spreen et al., 2011; Wu et al., 2012), regional atmospheric circulation patterns (Overland and Wang, 2010;
Screen et al., 2018; Rinke et al., 2019) and abnormal storm activities (Simmonds et al., 2008; Simmonds and Keay, 2009;
Screen et al., 2011; Simmonds and Rudeva, 2012; Parkinson and Comiso, 2013; Simmonds and Rudeva, 2014). Cloud (Kapsch
et al., 2013), radiation (Kay and Gettelman, 2009; Choi et al., 2014) and precipitation (Boisvert et al., 2018; Wang
et al., 2019; Marcovecchio et al., 2021) are the important thermodynamic factors controlling Arctic sea ice trends
and variability. On the other hand, sea ice decline in turn exerts large influence on the atmosphere, including
cloud (Kay and Gettelman, 2009; Morrison et al., 2018), surface energy budget (Semmler et al., 2012; Boisvert et al.,
2015; Boisvert and Stroeve, 2015), precipitation (Bintanja and Selten, 2014; Kopec et al., 2016) and large-scale
circulation (Chemke et al., 2019; Kennel and Yulaeva, 2020). Figure 1 depicts the causal relations between key
atmospheric variables and sea ice over the Arctic. The sea ice here represents sea ice coverage and/or sea ice
thickness. Note that the processes a âˆ’ d are well-known atmospheric processes, including cloud microphysics,
thermodynamics, radiation, climate dynamics, which have been studied over the past few decades. The processes
e âˆ’ i are summarized from more recent publications, which are still under investigation by climate scientists.
We will explain processes e âˆ’ i in details in the next paragraph. The arrow e represents the two-way effect between
sea ice and net longwave flux at the surface. Based on global reanalysis (Kapsch et al., 2013; Lee et al., 2017),
surface (Cox et al., 2016) and satellite observations (Huang et al., 2017), as well as model simulations (Kapsch et
al., 2016; Huang et al., 2019a), the downward longwave radiation at the surface dominates surface warming and
therefore enhances sea ice melt in winter and spring. The increase in downward longwave flux is a result of an
increase in cloudiness and moisture in the Arctic Basin, which is caused by enhanced local evaporation or moisture
transport from mid-latitudes (Luo et al., 2017). Positive anomalies of longwave flux in spring and early summer
initiate an earlier melt onset, thereby triggering several feedback mechanisms which amplify melt during the
succeeding months (Kapsch et al., 2016; Huang et al., 2019b). The sea ice melt increases the air temperature

atmospheric processes with changes in Arctic sea ice. Therefore, in this study, we target to provide a more
comprehensive analysis about causality between multiple atmospheric processes and sea ice by applying different
data-driven causality approaches.

wind (v-component) anomaly that drives more sea ice out of the Arctic Ocean. In addition, this dipole anomaly promotes
transport of heat and moisture and thus enhances downward longwave radiation and control the melt onset
(Huang et al., 2019b; Kapsch et al., 2019). Moreover, the changes in cyclone occurrence and/or depth during spring
(Screen et al., 2011) and summer (Simmonds and Rudeva, 2012) have preconditioning effects on the sea ice cover and
exert a strong influence on the amount of sea ice that survives the melt season. A recent study also pointed out that
a stronger anticyclonic circulation over Greenland and the Arctic Ocean in the troposphere may have contributed as much
as 60% to the September sea ice extent decline since 1979, by warming and moistening the lower atmosphere

These conclusions are mainly drawn from in-situ measurements during field campaign (Perovich et al., 2002; Sturm et al.,
2002), global reanalysis products and surface observations (Screen and Simmonds, 2012; Boisvert et al., 2018;
Wang et al., 2019). The higher precipitation and snowfall could result in a thicker snowpack that allows less heat
loss to the atmosphere. More importantly, modeling studies suggest that increases in Arctic precipitation over the
21st century, particularly in late autumn and winter, are due mainly to strongly intensified local surface evaporation
(latent heat flux) (Bintanja and Selten, 2014). Therefore, we believe that Arctic precipitation exerts direct influence
on sea ice variations (arrow i), while sea ice modulates precipitation mainly through sensible plus latent heat flux
(arrows h, b). Among these studies, very few of them have demonstrated the delayed impact of one variable on another.
Specifically, the net shortwave flux at the surface in early summer (Mayâ€“July) is found to enhance sea ice melt with a
lag of 1â€“4 months (Choi et al., 2014). Moreover, the sea ice condition exhibits the delayed impacts on itself, which is
called sea ice anomaly persistence (Guemas et al., 2016; Cruz-GarcÃ­a et al., 2019; Holland et al., 2019). The sea ice
anomaly persistence depends on the predictand (area, extent, volume), region, and the initial and target dates, which
can be varied from a few days to a few years (Guemas et al., 2016). With sea ice anomaly persistence,
there is predictability for the sea ice area in winter but low predictability throughout the rest of the year in
peripheral seas. Based on multiple model simulations, the Labrador Sea stands out among the considered regions,
with sea ice predictability extending up to 1.5 years (Cruz-GarcÃ­a et al., 2019). Note that most of studies mentioned
above determine the changes in one variable, happening before another one, by applying time series analysis and/or
composite analysis based on observations, reanalysis or model output (Perovich et al., 2002; Sturm et al., 2002; Kay
and Gettelman, 2009; Wang et al., 2009; Nussbaumer and Pinker, 2012; Kapsch et al., 2013; Choi et al., 2014; Boisvert

2018; Wang et al., 2019). Among them, some studies use more advanced statistical analysis such as empirical orthogonal
function (Watanabe et al., 2006; Overland and Wang, 2010) and self-organizing map (Kapsch et al., 2019; Rinke et al.,
2019). Other studies assess the causal links through targeted modeling experiments (Bintanja and Selten, 2014; Kapsch
et al., 2016; Ding et al., 2017; Huang et al., 2019a; Cruz-GarcÃ­a et al., 2019), in order to test whether a manipulation
of one variable has an impact on others. And most of the studies focus on relationships between only one or two

(Ding et al., 2017; Huang et al., 2021; Luo et al., 2021). On the other hand, the reduction in Arctic sea ice extent
and increase in open water area in late summer are found to directly contribute to a modification of large-scale

Huang et al. Arctic Sea Ice Causality Discovery circulation patterns in the following autumn through the additional
heat stored in the Arctic Ocean and released to the atmosphere during the autumn (Overland and Wang, 2010). The
increased 1,000â€“500 hPa thickness in autumn produce anomalous easterley zonal wind component (u-component), especially
over the north of Alaska and Canada. Moreover, a more meridional flow pattern associated with sea ice reduction have
an impact on the mid-latitude weather (Overland and Wang, 2010). These conclusions are mainly drawn from model
simulations (Watanabe et al., 2006; Rinke et al., 2019), reanalysis and observations (Wang et al., 2009; Overland and
Wang, 2010; Kapsch et al., 2019). In addition to radiation, the sensible plus latent heat flux also plays an important
role in the Arctic energy budget. The increase in the downward moisture flux triggers the melting of the sea ice in
spring (Boisvert et al., 2015; Boisvert and Stroeve, 2015; Marcovecchio et al., 2021). Earlier melt onset and loss of
sea ice in the spring enhance warming of the ice-free ocean surface, which in turn leads to an increase of evaporation
from the surface into the atmosphere in the autumn. This positive feedback between heat flux and sea ice, indicated
by arrow h, has been confirmed by satellite observations (Boisvert et al., 2015; Boisvert and Stroeve, 2015) and model
simulations (Huang et al., 2019a) during most months of the year. The arrow i represents the influence of precipitation
on Arctic sea ice variations. Specifically, the magnitude of precipitation accumulating over the sea ice pack largely
determines the depth of the snow layer, which modulates the rate of sea ice growth because of its highly insulating
properties (Sturm et al., 2002). The phase of the precipitation falling on the sea ice pack is also important. As rain,
it can melt, compact, and densify the snowpack, thus reducing the surface albedo and promoting sea ice melt (Perovich
et al., 2002).The recent snowfall decline in summer is essentially caused by changes in precipitation form (snow
turning to rain) with very little influence of decreases in total precipitation, which is a result of
lower-atmospheric warming. Then the loss of snow-on-ice results in a substantial decrease in the surface albedo over
the Arctic Ocean, causing additional surface ice melt by absorbing more solar radiation (Screen and Simmonds, 2012).

CAUSALITY BETWEEN ATMOSPHERIC PROCESSES AND ARCTIC SEA ICE VARIATIONS
Due to the two-way interactions between the atmosphere and sea ice, studying causality between them is a challenging but
important task, which makes it an area of high interest within polar climate community. The sea ice variations can be
caused by different dynamical and thermodynamical processes. Important dynamical processes include anomalous surface
wind (Spreen et al., 2011; Wu et al., 2012), regional atmospheric circulation patterns (Overland and Wang, 2010;
Screen et al., 2018; Rinke et al., 2019) and abnormal storm activities (Simmonds et al., 2008; Simmonds and Keay, 2009;
Screen et al., 2011; Simmonds and Rudeva, 2012; Parkinson and Comiso, 2013; Simmonds and Rudeva, 2014). Cloud (Kapsch
et al., 2013), radiation (Kay and Gettelman, 2009; Choi et al., 2014) and precipitation (Boisvert et al., 2018; Wang
et al., 2019; Marcovecchio et al., 2021) are the important thermodynamic factors controlling Arctic sea ice trends
and variability. On the other hand, sea ice decline in turn exerts large influence on the atmosphere, including
cloud (Kay and Gettelman, 2009; Morrison et al., 2018), surface energy budget (Semmler et al., 2012; Boisvert et al.,
2015; Boisvert and Stroeve, 2015), precipitation (Bintanja and Selten, 2014; Kopec et al., 2016) and large-scale
circulation (Chemke et al., 2019; Kennel and Yulaeva, 2020). Figure 1 depicts the causal relations between key
atmospheric variables and sea ice over the Arctic. The sea ice here represents sea ice coverage and/or sea ice
thickness. Note that the processes a âˆ’ d are well-known atmospheric processes, including cloud microphysics,
thermodynamics, radiation, climate dynamics, which have been studied over the past few decades. The processes
e âˆ’ i are summarized from more recent publications, which are still under investigation by climate scientists.
We will explain processes e âˆ’ i in details in the next paragraph. The arrow e represents the two-way effect between
sea ice and net longwave flux at the surface. Based on global reanalysis (Kapsch et al., 2013; Lee et al., 2017),
surface (Cox et al., 2016) and satellite observations (Huang et al., 2017), as well as model simulations (Kapsch et
al., 2016; Huang et al., 2019a), the downward longwave radiation at the surface dominates surface warming and
therefore enhances sea ice melt in winter and spring. The increase in downward longwave flux is a result of an
increase in cloudiness and moisture in the Arctic Basin, which is caused by enhanced local evaporation or moisture
transport from mid-latitudes (Luo et al., 2017). Positive anomalies of longwave flux in spring and early summer
initiate an earlier melt onset, thereby triggering several feedback mechanisms which amplify melt during the
succeeding months (Kapsch et al., 2016; Huang et al., 2019b). The sea ice melt increases the air temperature

atmospheric processes with changes in Arctic sea ice. Therefore, in this study, we target to provide a more
comprehensive analysis about causality between multiple atmospheric processes and sea ice by applying different
data-driven causality approaches.

important after the melt has started (Kapsch et al., 2013; Huang et al., 2017). Once the surface albedo is
significantly reduced due to sea ice melt, the solar radiation could be absorbed by ocean, which further
accelerates ice melt in late spring and summer (Kay and Gettelman, 2009; Choi et al., 2014; Kapsch et al., 2016).

Huang et al. Arctic Sea Ice Causality Discovery circulation patterns in the following autumn through the additional
heat stored in the Arctic Ocean and released to the atmosphere during the autumn (Overland and Wang, 2010). The
increased 1,000â€“500 hPa thickness in autumn produce anomalous easterley zonal wind component (u-component), especially
over the north of Alaska and Canada. Moreover, a more meridional flow pattern associated with sea ice reduction have
an impact on the mid-latitude weather (Overland and Wang, 2010). These conclusions are mainly drawn from model
simulations (Watanabe et al., 2006; Rinke et al., 2019), reanalysis and observations (Wang et al., 2009; Overland and
Wang, 2010; Kapsch et al., 2019). In addition to radiation, the sensible plus latent heat flux also plays an important
role in the Arctic energy budget. The increase in the downward moisture flux triggers the melting of the sea ice in
spring (Boisvert et al., 2015; Boisvert and Stroeve, 2015; Marcovecchio et al., 2021). Earlier melt onset and loss of
sea ice in the spring enhance warming of the ice-free ocean surface, which in turn leads to an increase of evaporation
from the surface into the atmosphere in the autumn. This positive feedback between heat flux and sea ice, indicated
by arrow h, has been confirmed by satellite observations (Boisvert et al., 2015; Boisvert and Stroeve, 2015) and model
simulations (Huang et al., 2019a) during most months of the year. The arrow i represents the influence of precipitation
on Arctic sea ice variations. Specifically, the magnitude of precipitation accumulating over the sea ice pack largely
determines the depth of the snow layer, which modulates the rate of sea ice growth because of its highly insulating
properties (Sturm et al., 2002). The phase of the precipitation falling on the sea ice pack is also important. As rain,
it can melt, compact, and densify the snowpack, thus reducing the surface albedo and promoting sea ice melt (Perovich
et al., 2002).The recent snowfall decline in summer is essentially caused by changes in precipitation form (snow
turning to rain) with very little influence of decreases in total precipitation, which is a result of
lower-atmospheric warming. Then the loss of snow-on-ice results in a substantial decrease in the surface albedo over
the Arctic Ocean, causing additional surface ice melt by absorbing more solar radiation (Screen and Simmonds, 2012).

CAUSALITY BETWEEN ATMOSPHERIC PROCESSES AND ARCTIC SEA ICE VARIATIONS
Due to the two-way interactions between the atmosphere and sea ice, studying causality between them is a challenging but
important task, which makes it an area of high interest within polar climate community. The sea ice variations can be
caused by different dynamical and thermodynamical processes. Important dynamical processes include anomalous surface
wind (Spreen et al., 2011; Wu et al., 2012), regional atmospheric circulation patterns (Overland and Wang, 2010;
Screen et al., 2018; Rinke et al., 2019) and abnormal storm activities (Simmonds et al., 2008; Simmonds and Keay, 2009;
Screen et al., 2011; Simmonds and Rudeva, 2012; Parkinson and Comiso, 2013; Simmonds and Rudeva, 2014). Cloud (Kapsch
et al., 2013), radiation (Kay and Gettelman, 2009; Choi et al., 2014) and precipitation (Boisvert et al., 2018; Wang
et al., 2019; Marcovecchio et al., 2021) are the important thermodynamic factors controlling Arctic sea ice trends
and variability. On the other hand, sea ice decline in turn exerts large influence on the atmosphere, including
cloud (Kay and Gettelman, 2009; Morrison et al., 2018), surface energy budget (Semmler et al., 2012; Boisvert et al.,
2015; Boisvert and Stroeve, 2015), precipitation (Bintanja and Selten, 2014; Kopec et al., 2016) and large-scale
circulation (Chemke et al., 2019; Kennel and Yulaeva, 2020). Figure 1 depicts the causal relations between key
atmospheric variables and sea ice over the Arctic. The sea ice here represents sea ice coverage and/or sea ice
thickness. Note that the processes a âˆ’ d are well-known atmospheric processes, including cloud microphysics,
thermodynamics, radiation, climate dynamics, which have been studied over the past few decades. The processes
e âˆ’ i are summarized from more recent publications, which are still under investigation by climate scientists.
We will explain processes e âˆ’ i in details in the next paragraph. The arrow e represents the two-way effect between
sea ice and net longwave flux at the surface. Based on global reanalysis (Kapsch et al., 2013; Lee et al., 2017),
surface (Cox et al., 2016) and satellite observations (Huang et al., 2017), as well as model simulations (Kapsch et
al., 2016; Huang et al., 2019a), the downward longwave radiation at the surface dominates surface warming and
therefore enhances sea ice melt in winter and spring. The increase in downward longwave flux is a result of an
increase in cloudiness and moisture in the Arctic Basin, which is caused by enhanced local evaporation or moisture
transport from mid-latitudes (Luo et al., 2017). Positive anomalies of longwave flux in spring and early summer
initiate an earlier melt onset, thereby triggering several feedback mechanisms which amplify melt during the
succeeding months (Kapsch et al., 2016; Huang et al., 2019b). The sea ice melt increases the air temperature

atmospheric processes with changes in Arctic sea ice. Therefore, in this study, we target to provide a more
comprehensive analysis about causality between multiple atmospheric processes and sea ice by applying different
data-driven causality approaches.

Huang et al. Arctic Sea Ice Causality Discovery surface. The downward shortwave flux, however, appears only
important after the melt has started (Kapsch et al., 2013; Huang et al., 2017). Once the surface albedo is
significantly reduced due to sea ice melt, the solar radiation could be absorbed by ocean, which further
accelerates ice melt in late spring and summer (Kay and Gettelman, 2009; Choi et al., 2014; Kapsch et al., 2016).
The feedback between surface net shortwave flux and sea ice, represented by arrow f in Figure 1, has been
confirmed by both model simulations (Kapsch et al., 2016) and satellite observations (Kay and Gettelman, 2009;
Nussbaumer and Pinker, 2012; Choi et al., 2014). The arrows g indicate the interactions between the sea ice variations
and atmospheric dynamical processes. A series of studies demonstrated that recent loss of Arctic sea ice is triggered
by the atmospheric circulation changes such as a tendency toward a dipole pattern in the mean sea level pressure trend
with an increase over the Arctic Ocean and a decrease over Siberia. The Arctic dipole anomaly in summer
(Wang et al., 2009), winter (Watanabe et al., 2006) and spring (Kapsch et al., 2019) produces a strong meridional
wind (v-component) anomaly that drives more sea ice out of the Arctic Ocean. In addition, this dipole anomaly promotes
transport of heat and moisture and thus enhances downward longwave radiation and control the melt onset
(Huang et al., 2019b; Kapsch et al., 2019). Moreover, the changes in cyclone occurrence and/or depth during spring
(Screen et al., 2011) and summer (Simmonds and Rudeva, 2012) have preconditioning effects on the sea ice cover and
exert a strong influence on the amount of sea ice that survives the melt season. A recent study also pointed out that
a stronger anticyclonic circulation over Greenland and the Arctic Ocean in the troposphere may have contributed as much
as 60% to the September sea ice extent decline since 1979, by warming and moistening the lower atmosphere

These conclusions are mainly drawn from in-situ measurements during field campaign (Perovich et al., 2002; Sturm et al.,
2002), global reanalysis products and surface observations (Screen and Simmonds, 2012; Boisvert et al., 2018;
Wang et al., 2019). The higher precipitation and snowfall could result in a thicker snowpack that allows less heat
loss to the atmosphere. More importantly, modeling studies suggest that increases in Arctic precipitation over the
21st century, particularly in late autumn and winter, are due mainly to strongly intensified local surface evaporation
(latent heat flux) (Bintanja and Selten, 2014). Therefore, we believe that Arctic precipitation exerts direct influence
on sea ice variations (arrow i), while sea ice modulates precipitation mainly through sensible plus latent heat flux
(arrows h, b). Among these studies, very few of them have demonstrated the delayed impact of one variable on another.
Specifically, the net shortwave flux at the surface in early summer (Mayâ€“July) is found to enhance sea ice melt with a
lag of 1â€“4 months (Choi et al., 2014). Moreover, the sea ice condition exhibits the delayed impacts on itself, which is
called sea ice anomaly persistence (Guemas et al., 2016; Cruz-GarcÃ­a et al., 2019; Holland et al., 2019). The sea ice
anomaly persistence depends on the predictand (area, extent, volume), region, and the initial and target dates, which
can be varied from a few days to a few years (Guemas et al., 2016). With sea ice anomaly persistence,
there is predictability for the sea ice area in winter but low predictability throughout the rest of the year in
peripheral seas. Based on multiple model simulations, the Labrador Sea stands out among the considered regions,
with sea ice predictability extending up to 1.5 years (Cruz-GarcÃ­a et al., 2019). Note that most of studies mentioned
above determine the changes in one variable, happening before another one, by applying time series analysis and/or
composite analysis based on observations, reanalysis or model output (Perovich et al., 2002; Sturm et al., 2002; Kay

simulations (Huang et al., 2019a) during most months of the year. The arrow i represents the influence of precipitation
on Arctic sea ice variations. Specifically, the magnitude of precipitation accumulating over the sea ice pack largely
determines the depth of the snow layer, which modulates the rate of sea ice growth because of its highly insulating
properties (Sturm et al., 2002). The phase of the precipitation falling on the sea ice pack is also important. As rain,
it can melt, compact, and densify the snowpack, thus reducing the surface albedo and promoting sea ice melt (Perovich
et al., 2002).The recent snowfall decline in summer is essentially caused by changes in precipitation form (snow
turning to rain) with very little influence of decreases in total precipitation, which is a result of
lower-atmospheric warming. Then the loss of snow-on-ice results in a substantial decrease in the surface albedo over
the Arctic Ocean, causing additional surface ice melt by absorbing more solar radiation (Screen and Simmonds, 2012).

CAUSALITY BETWEEN ATMOSPHERIC PROCESSES AND ARCTIC SEA ICE VARIATIONS
Due to the two-way interactions between the atmosphere and sea ice, studying causality between them is a challenging but
important task, which makes it an area of high interest within polar climate community. The sea ice variations can be
caused by different dynamical and thermodynamical processes. Important dynamical processes include anomalous surface
wind (Spreen et al., 2011; Wu et al., 2012), regional atmospheric circulation patterns (Overland and Wang, 2010;
Screen et al., 2018; Rinke et al., 2019) and abnormal storm activities (Simmonds et al., 2008; Simmonds and Keay, 2009;
Screen et al., 2011; Simmonds and Rudeva, 2012; Parkinson and Comiso, 2013; Simmonds and Rudeva, 2014). Cloud (Kapsch
et al., 2013), radiation (Kay and Gettelman, 2009; Choi et al., 2014) and precipitation (Boisvert et al., 2018; Wang
et al., 2019; Marcovecchio et al., 2021) are the important thermodynamic factors controlling Arctic sea ice trends
and variability. On the other hand, sea ice decline in turn exerts large influence on the atmosphere, including
cloud (Kay and Gettelman, 2009; Morrison et al., 2018), surface energy budget (Semmler et al., 2012; Boisvert et al.,
2015; Boisvert and Stroeve, 2015), precipitation (Bintanja and Selten, 2014; Kopec et al., 2016) and large-scale
circulation (Chemke et al., 2019; Kennel and Yulaeva, 2020). Figure 1 depicts the causal relations between key
atmospheric variables and sea ice over the Arctic. The sea ice here represents sea ice coverage and/or sea ice
thickness. Note that the processes a âˆ’ d are well-known atmospheric processes, including cloud microphysics,
thermodynamics, radiation, climate dynamics, which have been studied over the past few decades. The processes
e âˆ’ i are summarized from more recent publications, which are still under investigation by climate scientists.
We will explain processes e âˆ’ i in details in the next paragraph. The arrow e represents the two-way effect between
sea ice and net longwave flux at the surface. Based on global reanalysis (Kapsch et al., 2013; Lee et al., 2017),
surface (Cox et al., 2016) and satellite observations (Huang et al., 2017), as well as model simulations (Kapsch et
al., 2016; Huang et al., 2019a), the downward longwave radiation at the surface dominates surface warming and
therefore enhances sea ice melt in winter and spring. The increase in downward longwave flux is a result of an
increase in cloudiness and moisture in the Arctic Basin, which is caused by enhanced local evaporation or moisture
transport from mid-latitudes (Luo et al., 2017). Positive anomalies of longwave flux in spring and early summer
initiate an earlier melt onset, thereby triggering several feedback mechanisms which amplify melt during the
succeeding months (Kapsch et al., 2016; Huang et al., 2019b). The sea ice melt increases the air temperature

atmospheric processes with changes in Arctic sea ice. Therefore, in this study, we target to provide a more
comprehensive analysis about causality between multiple atmospheric processes and sea ice by applying different
data-driven causality approaches.

Huang et al. Arctic Sea Ice Causality Discovery surface. The downward shortwave flux, however, appears only
important after the melt has started (Kapsch et al., 2013; Huang et al., 2017). Once the surface albedo is
significantly reduced due to sea ice melt, the solar radiation could be absorbed by ocean, which further
accelerates ice melt in late spring and summer (Kay and Gettelman, 2009; Choi et al., 2014; Kapsch et al., 2016).
The feedback between surface net shortwave flux and sea ice, represented by arrow f in Figure 1, has been
confirmed by both model simulations (Kapsch et al., 2016) and satellite observations (Kay and Gettelman, 2009;
Nussbaumer and Pinker, 2012; Choi et al., 2014). The arrows g indicate the interactions between the sea ice variations
and atmospheric dynamical processes. A series of studies demonstrated that recent loss of Arctic sea ice is triggered
by the atmospheric circulation changes such as a tendency toward a dipole pattern in the mean sea level pressure trend
with an increase over the Arctic Ocean and a decrease over Siberia. The Arctic dipole anomaly in summer
(Wang et al., 2009), winter (Watanabe et al., 2006) and spring (Kapsch et al., 2019) produces a strong meridional
wind (v-component) anomaly that drives more sea ice out of the Arctic Ocean. In addition, this dipole anomaly promotes
transport of heat and moisture and thus enhances downward longwave radiation and control the melt onset
(Huang et al., 2019b; Kapsch et al., 2019). Moreover, the changes in cyclone occurrence and/or depth during spring
(Screen et al., 2011) and summer (Simmonds and Rudeva, 2012) have preconditioning effects on the sea ice cover and
exert a strong influence on the amount of sea ice that survives the melt season. A recent study also pointed out that
a stronger anticyclonic circulation over Greenland and the Arctic Ocean in the troposphere may have contributed as much
as 60% to the September sea ice extent decline since 1979, by warming and moistening the lower atmosphere

These conclusions are mainly drawn from in-situ measurements during field campaign (Perovich et al., 2002; Sturm et al.,
2002), global reanalysis products and surface observations (Screen and Simmonds, 2012; Boisvert et al., 2018;
Wang et al., 2019). The higher precipitation and snowfall could result in a thicker snowpack that allows less heat
loss to the atmosphere. More importantly, modeling studies suggest that increases in Arctic precipitation over the
21st century, particularly in late autumn and winter, are due mainly to strongly intensified local surface evaporation
(latent heat flux) (Bintanja and Selten, 2014). Therefore, we believe that Arctic precipitation exerts direct influence
on sea ice variations (arrow i), while sea ice modulates precipitation mainly through sensible plus latent heat flux
(arrows h, b). Among these studies, very few of them have demonstrated the delayed impact of one variable on another.
Specifically, the net shortwave flux at the surface in early summer (Mayâ€“July) is found to enhance sea ice melt with a
lag of 1â€“4 months (Choi et al., 2014). Moreover, the sea ice condition exhibits the delayed impacts on itself, which is
called sea ice anomaly persistence (Guemas et al., 2016; Cruz-GarcÃ­a et al., 2019; Holland et al., 2019). The sea ice
anomaly persistence depends on the predictand (area, extent, volume), region, and the initial and target dates, which
can be varied from a few days to a few years (Guemas et al., 2016). With sea ice anomaly persistence,
there is predictability for the sea ice area in winter but low predictability throughout the rest of the year in
peripheral seas. Based on multiple model simulations, the Labrador Sea stands out among the considered regions,
with sea ice predictability extending up to 1.5 years (Cruz-GarcÃ­a et al., 2019). Note that most of studies mentioned
above determine the changes in one variable, happening before another one, by applying time series analysis and/or
composite analysis based on observations, reanalysis or model output (Perovich et al., 2002; Sturm et al., 2002; Kay
and Gettelman, 2009; Wang et al., 2009; Nussbaumer and Pinker, 2012; Kapsch et al., 2013; Choi et al., 2014; Boisvert
et al., 2015; Boisvert and Stroeve, 2015; Cox et al., 2016; Huang et al., 2017; Huang et al., 2019b; Boisvert et al.,
2018; Wang et al., 2019). Among them, some studies use more advanced statistical analysis such as empirical orthogonal
function (Watanabe et al., 2006; Overland and Wang, 2010) and self-organizing map (Kapsch et al., 2019; Rinke et al.,
2019). Other studies assess the causal links through targeted modeling experiments (Bintanja and Selten, 2014; Kapsch
et al., 2016; Ding et al., 2017; Huang et al., 2019a; Cruz-GarcÃ­a et al., 2019), in order to test whether a manipulation
of one variable has an impact on others. And most of the studies focus on relationships between only one or two

(Ding et al., 2017; Huang et al., 2021; Luo et al., 2021). On the other hand, the reduction in Arctic sea ice extent
and increase in open water area in late summer are found to directly contribute to a modification of large-scale

Huang et al. Arctic Sea Ice Causality Discovery circulation patterns in the following autumn through the additional
heat stored in the Arctic Ocean and released to the atmosphere during the autumn (Overland and Wang, 2010). The
increased 1,000â€“500 hPa thickness in autumn produce anomalous easterley zonal wind component (u-component), especially
over the north of Alaska and Canada. Moreover, a more meridional flow pattern associated with sea ice reduction have
an impact on the mid-latitude weather (Overland and Wang, 2010). These conclusions are mainly drawn from model
simulations (Watanabe et al., 2006; Rinke et al., 2019), reanalysis and observations (Wang et al., 2009; Overland and
Wang, 2010; Kapsch et al., 2019). In addition to radiation, the sensible plus latent heat flux also plays an important
role in the Arctic energy budget. The increase in the downward moisture flux triggers the melting of the sea ice in
spring (Boisvert et al., 2015; Boisvert and Stroeve, 2015; Marcovecchio et al., 2021). Earlier melt onset and loss of
sea ice in the spring enhance warming of the ice-free ocean surface, which in turn leads to an increase of evaporation
from the surface into the atmosphere in the autumn. This positive feedback between heat flux and sea ice, indicated
by arrow h, has been confirmed by satellite observations (Boisvert et al., 2015; Boisvert and Stroeve, 2015) and model

surface (Cox et al., 2016) and satellite observations (Huang et al., 2017), as well as model simulations (Kapsch et

therefore enhances sea ice melt in winter and spring. The increase in downward longwave flux is a result of an
increase in cloudiness and moisture in the Arctic Basin, which is caused by enhanced local evaporation or moisture
transport from mid-latitudes (Luo et al., 2017). Positive anomalies of longwave flux in spring and early summer
initiate an earlier melt onset, thereby triggering several feedback mechanisms which amplify melt during the
succeeding months (Kapsch et al., 2016; Huang et al., 2019b). The sea ice melt increases the air temperature

Huang et al. Arctic Sea Ice Causality Discovery surface. The downward shortwave flux, however, appears only
important after the melt has started (Kapsch et al., 2013; Huang et al., 2017). Once the surface albedo is
significantly reduced due to sea ice melt, the solar radiation could be absorbed by ocean, which further
accelerates ice melt in late spring and summer (Kay and Gettelman, 2009; Choi et al., 2014; Kapsch et al., 2016).
The feedback between surface net shortwave flux and sea ice, represented by arrow f in Figure 1, has been
confirmed by both model simulations (Kapsch et al., 2016) and satellite observations (Kay and Gettelman, 2009;
Nussbaumer and Pinker, 2012; Choi et al., 2014). The arrows g indicate the interactions between the sea ice variations
and atmospheric dynamical processes. A series of studies demonstrated that recent loss of Arctic sea ice is triggered
by the atmospheric circulation changes such as a tendency toward a dipole pattern in the mean sea level pressure trend
with an increase over the Arctic Ocean and a decrease over Siberia. The Arctic dipole anomaly in summer
(Wang et al., 2009), winter (Watanabe et al., 2006) and spring (Kapsch et al., 2019) produces a strong meridional
wind (v-component) anomaly that drives more sea ice out of the Arctic Ocean. In addition, this dipole anomaly promotes
transport of heat and moisture and thus enhances downward longwave radiation and control the melt onset
(Huang et al., 2019b; Kapsch et al., 2019). Moreover, the changes in cyclone occurrence and/or depth during spring
(Screen et al., 2011) and summer (Simmonds and Rudeva, 2012) have preconditioning effects on the sea ice cover and
exert a strong influence on the amount of sea ice that survives the melt season. A recent study also pointed out that
a stronger anticyclonic circulation over Greenland and the Arctic Ocean in the troposphere may have contributed as much
as 60% to the September sea ice extent decline since 1979, by warming and moistening the lower atmosphere

These conclusions are mainly drawn from in-situ measurements during field campaign (Perovich et al., 2002; Sturm et al.,
2002), global reanalysis products and surface observations (Screen and Simmonds, 2012; Boisvert et al., 2018;
Wang et al., 2019). The higher precipitation and snowfall could result in a thicker snowpack that allows less heat
loss to the atmosphere. More importantly, modeling studies suggest that increases in Arctic precipitation over the
21st century, particularly in late autumn and winter, are due mainly to strongly intensified local surface evaporation
(latent heat flux) (Bintanja and Selten, 2014). Therefore, we believe that Arctic precipitation exerts direct influence
on sea ice variations (arrow i), while sea ice modulates precipitation mainly through sensible plus latent heat flux
(arrows h, b). Among these studies, very few of them have demonstrated the delayed impact of one variable on another.
Specifically, the net shortwave flux at the surface in early summer (Mayâ€“July) is found to enhance sea ice melt with a
lag of 1â€“4 months (Choi et al., 2014). Moreover, the sea ice condition exhibits the delayed impacts on itself, which is
called sea ice anomaly persistence (Guemas et al., 2016; Cruz-GarcÃ­a et al., 2019; Holland et al., 2019). The sea ice
anomaly persistence depends on the predictand (area, extent, volume), region, and the initial and target dates, which
can be varied from a few days to a few years (Guemas et al., 2016). With sea ice anomaly persistence,
there is predictability for the sea ice area in winter but low predictability throughout the rest of the year in
peripheral seas. Based on multiple model simulations, the Labrador Sea stands out among the considered regions,
with sea ice predictability extending up to 1.5 years (Cruz-GarcÃ­a et al., 2019). Note that most of studies mentioned
above determine the changes in one variable, happening before another one, by applying time series analysis and/or
composite analysis based on observations, reanalysis or model output (Perovich et al., 2002; Sturm et al., 2002; Kay
and Gettelman, 2009; Wang et al., 2009; Nussbaumer and Pinker, 2012; Kapsch et al., 2013; Choi et al., 2014; Boisvert

2018; Wang et al., 2019). Among them, some studies use more advanced statistical analysis such as empirical orthogonal
function (Watanabe et al., 2006; Overland and Wang, 2010) and self-organizing map (Kapsch et al., 2019; Rinke et al.,
2019). Other studies assess the causal links through targeted modeling experiments (Bintanja and Selten, 2014; Kapsch
et al., 2016; Ding et al., 2017; Huang et al., 2019a; Cruz-GarcÃ­a et al., 2019), in order to test whether a manipulation
of one variable has an impact on others. And most of the studies focus on relationships between only one or two

(Ding et al., 2017; Huang et al., 2021; Luo et al., 2021). On the other hand, the reduction in Arctic sea ice extent
and increase in open water area in late summer are found to directly contribute to a modification of large-scale

Huang et al. Arctic Sea Ice Causality Discovery circulation patterns in the following autumn through the additional
heat stored in the Arctic Ocean and released to the atmosphere during the autumn (Overland and Wang, 2010). The
increased 1,000â€“500 hPa thickness in autumn produce anomalous easterley zonal wind component (u-component), especially
over the north of Alaska and Canada. Moreover, a more meridional flow pattern associated with sea ice reduction have
an impact on the mid-latitude weather (Overland and Wang, 2010). These conclusions are mainly drawn from model
simulations (Watanabe et al., 2006; Rinke et al., 2019), reanalysis and observations (Wang et al., 2009; Overland and
Wang, 2010; Kapsch et al., 2019). In addition to radiation, the sensible plus latent heat flux also plays an important
role in the Arctic energy budget. The increase in the downward moisture flux triggers the melting of the sea ice in
spring (Boisvert et al., 2015; Boisvert and Stroeve, 2015; Marcovecchio et al., 2021). Earlier melt onset and loss of
sea ice in the spring enhance warming of the ice-free ocean surface, which in turn leads to an increase of evaporation
from the surface into the atmosphere in the autumn. This positive feedback between heat flux and sea ice, indicated
by arrow h, has been confirmed by satellite observations (Boisvert et al., 2015; Boisvert and Stroeve, 2015) and model
simulations (Huang et al., 2019a) during most months of the year. The arrow i represents the influence of precipitation
on Arctic sea ice variations. Specifically, the magnitude of precipitation accumulating over the sea ice pack largely
determines the depth of the snow layer, which modulates the rate of sea ice growth because of its highly insulating
properties (Sturm et al., 2002). The phase of the precipitation falling on the sea ice pack is also important. As rain,
it can melt, compact, and densify the snowpack, thus reducing the surface albedo and promoting sea ice melt (Perovich
et al., 2002).The recent snowfall decline in summer is essentially caused by changes in precipitation form (snow
turning to rain) with very little influence of decreases in total precipitation, which is a result of
lower-atmospheric warming. Then the loss of snow-on-ice results in a substantial decrease in the surface albedo over
the Arctic Ocean, causing additional surface ice melt by absorbing more solar radiation (Screen and Simmonds, 2012).

CAUSALITY BETWEEN ATMOSPHERIC PROCESSES AND ARCTIC SEA ICE VARIATIONS
Due to the two-way interactions between the atmosphere and sea ice, studying causality between them is a challenging but
important task, which makes it an area of high interest within polar climate community. The sea ice variations can be
caused by different dynamical and thermodynamical processes. Important dynamical processes include anomalous surface
wind (Spreen et al., 2011; Wu et al., 2012), regional atmospheric circulation patterns (Overland and Wang, 2010;
Screen et al., 2018; Rinke et al., 2019) and abnormal storm activities (Simmonds et al., 2008; Simmonds and Keay, 2009;
Screen et al., 2011; Simmonds and Rudeva, 2012; Parkinson and Comiso, 2013; Simmonds and Rudeva, 2014). Cloud (Kapsch
et al., 2013), radiation (Kay and Gettelman, 2009; Choi et al., 2014) and precipitation (Boisvert et al., 2018; Wang
et al., 2019; Marcovecchio et al., 2021) are the important thermodynamic factors controlling Arctic sea ice trends
and variability. On the other hand, sea ice decline in turn exerts large influence on the atmosphere, including
cloud (Kay and Gettelman, 2009; Morrison et al., 2018), surface energy budget (Semmler et al., 2012; Boisvert et al.,
2015; Boisvert and Stroeve, 2015), precipitation (Bintanja and Selten, 2014; Kopec et al., 2016) and large-scale
circulation (Chemke et al., 2019; Kennel and Yulaeva, 2020). Figure 1 depicts the causal relations between key
atmospheric variables and sea ice over the Arctic. The sea ice here represents sea ice coverage and/or sea ice

Huang et al. Arctic Sea Ice Causality Discovery surface. The downward shortwave flux, however, appears only
important after the melt has started (Kapsch et al., 2013; Huang et al., 2017). Once the surface albedo is
significantly reduced due to sea ice melt, the solar radiation could be absorbed by ocean, which further
accelerates ice melt in late spring and summer (Kay and Gettelman, 2009; Choi et al., 2014; Kapsch et al., 2016).
The feedback between surface net shortwave flux and sea ice, represented by arrow f in Figure 1, has been
confirmed by both model simulations (Kapsch et al., 2016) and satellite observations (Kay and Gettelman, 2009;
Nussbaumer and Pinker, 2012; Choi et al., 2014). The arrows g indicate the interactions between the sea ice variations
and atmospheric dynamical processes. A series of studies demonstrated that recent loss of Arctic sea ice is triggered
by the atmospheric circulation changes such as a tendency toward a dipole pattern in the mean sea level pressure trend
with an increase over the Arctic Ocean and a decrease over Siberia. The Arctic dipole anomaly in summer
(Wang et al., 2009), winter (Watanabe et al., 2006) and spring (Kapsch et al., 2019) produces a strong meridional
wind (v-component) anomaly that drives more sea ice out of the Arctic Ocean. In addition, this dipole anomaly promotes
transport of heat and moisture and thus enhances downward longwave radiation and control the melt onset
(Huang et al., 2019b; Kapsch et al., 2019). Moreover, the changes in cyclone occurrence and/or depth during spring
(Screen et al., 2011) and summer (Simmonds and Rudeva, 2012) have preconditioning effects on the sea ice cover and
exert a strong influence on the amount of sea ice that survives the melt season. A recent study also pointed out that
a stronger anticyclonic circulation over Greenland and the Arctic Ocean in the troposphere may have contributed as much
as 60% to the September sea ice extent decline since 1979, by warming and moistening the lower atmosphere

These conclusions are mainly drawn from in-situ measurements during field campaign (Perovich et al., 2002; Sturm et al.,
2002), global reanalysis products and surface observations (Screen and Simmonds, 2012; Boisvert et al., 2018;
Wang et al., 2019). The higher precipitation and snowfall could result in a thicker snowpack that allows less heat
loss to the atmosphere. More importantly, modeling studies suggest that increases in Arctic precipitation over the
21st century, particularly in late autumn and winter, are due mainly to strongly intensified local surface evaporation
(latent heat flux) (Bintanja and Selten, 2014). Therefore, we believe that Arctic precipitation exerts direct influence
on sea ice variations (arrow i), while sea ice modulates precipitation mainly through sensible plus latent heat flux
(arrows h, b). Among these studies, very few of them have demonstrated the delayed impact of one variable on another.
Specifically, the net shortwave flux at the surface in early summer (Mayâ€“July) is found to enhance sea ice melt with a
lag of 1â€“4 months (Choi et al., 2014). Moreover, the sea ice condition exhibits the delayed impacts on itself, which is
called sea ice anomaly persistence (Guemas et al., 2016; Cruz-GarcÃ­a et al., 2019; Holland et al., 2019). The sea ice
anomaly persistence depends on the predictand (area, extent, volume), region, and the initial and target dates, which
can be varied from a few days to a few years (Guemas et al., 2016). With sea ice anomaly persistence,
there is predictability for the sea ice area in winter but low predictability throughout the rest of the year in
peripheral seas. Based on multiple model simulations, the Labrador Sea stands out among the considered regions,
with sea ice predictability extending up to 1.5 years (Cruz-GarcÃ­a et al., 2019). Note that most of studies mentioned
above determine the changes in one variable, happening before another one, by applying time series analysis and/or
composite analysis based on observations, reanalysis or model output (Perovich et al., 2002; Sturm et al., 2002; Kay
and Gettelman, 2009; Wang et al., 2009; Nussbaumer and Pinker, 2012; Kapsch et al., 2013; Choi et al., 2014; Boisvert
et al., 2015; Boisvert and Stroeve, 2015; Cox et al., 2016; Huang et al., 2017; Huang et al., 2019b; Boisvert et al.,
2018; Wang et al., 2019). Among them, some studies use more advanced statistical analysis such as empirical orthogonal
function (Watanabe et al., 2006; Overland and Wang, 2010) and self-organizing map (Kapsch et al., 2019; Rinke et al.,
2019). Other studies assess the causal links through targeted modeling experiments (Bintanja and Selten, 2014; Kapsch
et al., 2016; Ding et al., 2017; Huang et al., 2019a; Cruz-GarcÃ­a et al., 2019), in order to test whether a manipulation
of one variable has an impact on others. And most of the studies focus on relationships between only one or two

(Ding et al., 2017; Huang et al., 2021; Luo et al., 2021). On the other hand, the reduction in Arctic sea ice extent
and increase in open water area in late summer are found to directly contribute to a modification of large-scale

Huang et al. Arctic Sea Ice Causality Discovery circulation patterns in the following autumn through the additional
heat stored in the Arctic Ocean and released to the atmosphere during the autumn (Overland and Wang, 2010). The
increased 1,000â€“500 hPa thickness in autumn produce anomalous easterley zonal wind component (u-component), especially
over the north of Alaska and Canada. Moreover, a more meridional flow pattern associated with sea ice reduction have
an impact on the mid-latitude weather (Overland and Wang, 2010). These conclusions are mainly drawn from model
simulations (Watanabe et al., 2006; Rinke et al., 2019), reanalysis and observations (Wang et al., 2009; Overland and
Wang, 2010; Kapsch et al., 2019). In addition to radiation, the sensible plus latent heat flux also plays an important
role in the Arctic energy budget. The increase in the downward moisture flux triggers the melting of the sea ice in
spring (Boisvert et al., 2015; Boisvert and Stroeve, 2015; Marcovecchio et al., 2021). Earlier melt onset and loss of
sea ice in the spring enhance warming of the ice-free ocean surface, which in turn leads to an increase of evaporation
from the surface into the atmosphere in the autumn. This positive feedback between heat flux and sea ice, indicated
by arrow h, has been confirmed by satellite observations (Boisvert et al., 2015; Boisvert and Stroeve, 2015) and model
simulations (Huang et al., 2019a) during most months of the year. The arrow i represents the influence of precipitation
on Arctic sea ice variations. Specifically, the magnitude of precipitation accumulating over the sea ice pack largely
determines the depth of the snow layer, which modulates the rate of sea ice growth because of its highly insulating
properties (Sturm et al., 2002). The phase of the precipitation falling on the sea ice pack is also important. As rain,
it can melt, compact, and densify the snowpack, thus reducing the surface albedo and promoting sea ice melt (Perovich
et al., 2002).The recent snowfall decline in summer is essentially caused by changes in precipitation form (snow
turning to rain) with very little influence of decreases in total precipitation, which is a result of
lower-atmospheric warming. Then the loss of snow-on-ice results in a substantial decrease in the surface albedo over
the Arctic Ocean, causing additional surface ice melt by absorbing more solar radiation (Screen and Simmonds, 2012).

CAUSALITY BETWEEN ATMOSPHERIC PROCESSES AND ARCTIC SEA ICE VARIATIONS
Due to the two-way interactions between the atmosphere and sea ice, studying causality between them is a challenging but
important task, which makes it an area of high interest within polar climate community. The sea ice variations can be
caused by different dynamical and thermodynamical processes. Important dynamical processes include anomalous surface
wind (Spreen et al., 2011; Wu et al., 2012), regional atmospheric circulation patterns (Overland and Wang, 2010;
Screen et al., 2018; Rinke et al., 2019) and abnormal storm activities (Simmonds et al., 2008; Simmonds and Keay, 2009;
Screen et al., 2011; Simmonds and Rudeva, 2012; Parkinson and Comiso, 2013; Simmonds and Rudeva, 2014). Cloud (Kapsch
et al., 2013), radiation (Kay and Gettelman, 2009; Choi et al., 2014) and precipitation (Boisvert et al., 2018; Wang
et al., 2019; Marcovecchio et al., 2021) are the important thermodynamic factors controlling Arctic sea ice trends
and variability. On the other hand, sea ice decline in turn exerts large influence on the atmosphere, including
cloud (Kay and Gettelman, 2009; Morrison et al., 2018), surface energy budget (Semmler et al., 2012; Boisvert et al.,
2015; Boisvert and Stroeve, 2015), precipitation (Bintanja and Selten, 2014; Kopec et al., 2016) and large-scale
circulation (Chemke et al., 2019; Kennel and Yulaeva, 2020). Figure 1 depicts the causal relations between key
atmospheric variables and sea ice over the Arctic. The sea ice here represents sea ice coverage and/or sea ice
thickness. Note that the processes a âˆ’ d are well-known atmospheric processes, including cloud microphysics,
thermodynamics, radiation, climate dynamics, which have been studied over the past few decades. The processes
e âˆ’ i are summarized from more recent publications, which are still under investigation by climate scientists.
We will explain processes e âˆ’ i in details in the next paragraph. The arrow e represents the two-way effect between
sea ice and net longwave flux at the surface. Based on global reanalysis (Kapsch et al., 2013; Lee et al., 2017),
surface (Cox et al., 2016) and satellite observations (Huang et al., 2017), as well as model simulations (Kapsch et
al., 2016; Huang et al., 2019a), the downward longwave radiation at the surface dominates surface warming and
therefore enhances sea ice melt in winter and spring. The increase in downward longwave flux is a result of an
increase in cloudiness and moisture in the Arctic Basin, which is caused by enhanced local evaporation or moisture
transport from mid-latitudes (Luo et al., 2017). Positive anomalies of longwave flux in spring and early summer
initiate an earlier melt onset, thereby triggering several feedback mechanisms which amplify melt during the
succeeding months (Kapsch et al., 2016; Huang et al., 2019b). The sea ice melt increases the air temperature

atmospheric processes with changes in Arctic sea ice. Therefore, in this study, we target to provide a more
comprehensive analysis about causality between multiple atmospheric processes and sea ice by applying different
data-driven causality approaches.

21st century, particularly in late autumn and winter, are due mainly to strongly intensified local surface evaporation
(latent heat flux) (Bintanja and Selten, 2014). Therefore, we believe that Arctic precipitation exerts direct influence
on sea ice variations (arrow i), while sea ice modulates precipitation mainly through sensible plus latent heat flux
(arrows h, b). Among these studies, very few of them have demonstrated the delayed impact of one variable on another.
Specifically, the net shortwave flux at the surface in early summer (Mayâ€“July) is found to enhance sea ice melt with a
lag of 1â€“4 months (Choi et al., 2014). Moreover, the sea ice condition exhibits the delayed impacts on itself, which is
called sea ice anomaly persistence (Guemas et al., 2016; Cruz-GarcÃ­a et al., 2019; Holland et al., 2019). The sea ice
anomaly persistence depends on the predictand (area, extent, volume), region, and the initial and target dates, which
can be varied from a few days to a few years (Guemas et al., 2016). With sea ice anomaly persistence,
there is predictability for the sea ice area in winter but low predictability throughout the rest of the year in
peripheral seas. Based on multiple model simulations, the Labrador Sea stands out among the considered regions,
with sea ice predictability extending up to 1.5 years (Cruz-GarcÃ­a et al., 2019). Note that most of studies mentioned
above determine the changes in one variable, happening before another one, by applying time series analysis and/or
composite analysis based on observations, reanalysis or model output (Perovich et al., 2002; Sturm et al., 2002; Kay
and Gettelman, 2009; Wang et al., 2009; Nussbaumer and Pinker, 2012; Kapsch et al., 2013; Choi et al., 2014; Boisvert

2018; Wang et al., 2019). Among them, some studies use more advanced statistical analysis such as empirical orthogonal
function (Watanabe et al., 2006; Overland and Wang, 2010) and self-organizing map (Kapsch et al., 2019; Rinke et al.,
2019). Other studies assess the causal links through targeted modeling experiments (Bintanja and Selten, 2014; Kapsch
et al., 2016; Ding et al., 2017; Huang et al., 2019a; Cruz-GarcÃ­a et al., 2019), in order to test whether a manipulation
of one variable has an impact on others. And most of the studies focus on relationships between only one or two

(Ding et al., 2017; Huang et al., 2021; Luo et al., 2021). On the other hand, the reduction in Arctic sea ice extent
and increase in open water area in late summer are found to directly contribute to a modification of large-scale

Huang et al. Arctic Sea Ice Causality Discovery circulation patterns in the following autumn through the additional
heat stored in the Arctic Ocean and released to the atmosphere during the autumn (Overland and Wang, 2010). The
increased 1,000â€“500 hPa thickness in autumn produce anomalous easterley zonal wind component (u-component), especially
over the north of Alaska and Canada. Moreover, a more meridional flow pattern associated with sea ice reduction have
an impact on the mid-latitude weather (Overland and Wang, 2010). These conclusions are mainly drawn from model
simulations (Watanabe et al., 2006; Rinke et al., 2019), reanalysis and observations (Wang et al., 2009; Overland and
Wang, 2010; Kapsch et al., 2019). In addition to radiation, the sensible plus latent heat flux also plays an important
role in the Arctic energy budget. The increase in the downward moisture flux triggers the melting of the sea ice in
spring (Boisvert et al., 2015; Boisvert and Stroeve, 2015; Marcovecchio et al., 2021). Earlier melt onset and loss of
sea ice in the spring enhance warming of the ice-free ocean surface, which in turn leads to an increase of evaporation
from the surface into the atmosphere in the autumn. This positive feedback between heat flux and sea ice, indicated
by arrow h, has been confirmed by satellite observations (Boisvert et al., 2015; Boisvert and Stroeve, 2015) and model
simulations (Huang et al., 2019a) during most months of the year. The arrow i represents the influence of precipitation
on Arctic sea ice variations. Specifically, the magnitude of precipitation accumulating over the sea ice pack largely
determines the depth of the snow layer, which modulates the rate of sea ice growth because of its highly insulating
properties (Sturm et al., 2002). The phase of the precipitation falling on the sea ice pack is also important. As rain,
it can melt, compact, and densify the snowpack, thus reducing the surface albedo and promoting sea ice melt (Perovich
et al., 2002).The recent snowfall decline in summer is essentially caused by changes in precipitation form (snow
turning to rain) with very little influence of decreases in total precipitation, which is a result of
lower-atmospheric warming. Then the loss of snow-on-ice results in a substantial decrease in the surface albedo over
the Arctic Ocean, causing additional surface ice melt by absorbing more solar radiation (Screen and Simmonds, 2012).

CAUSALITY BETWEEN ATMOSPHERIC PROCESSES AND ARCTIC SEA ICE VARIATIONS
Due to the two-way interactions between the atmosphere and sea ice, studying causality between them is a challenging but
important task, which makes it an area of high interest within polar climate community. The sea ice variations can be
caused by different dynamical and thermodynamical processes. Important dynamical processes include anomalous surface
wind (Spreen et al., 2011; Wu et al., 2012), regional atmospheric circulation patterns (Overland and Wang, 2010;
Screen et al., 2018; Rinke et al., 2019) and abnormal storm activities (Simmonds et al., 2008; Simmonds and Keay, 2009;
Screen et al., 2011; Simmonds and Rudeva, 2012; Parkinson and Comiso, 2013; Simmonds and Rudeva, 2014). Cloud (Kapsch
et al., 2013), radiation (Kay and Gettelman, 2009; Choi et al., 2014) and precipitation (Boisvert et al., 2018; Wang
et al., 2019; Marcovecchio et al., 2021) are the important thermodynamic factors controlling Arctic sea ice trends
and variability. On the other hand, sea ice decline in turn exerts large influence on the atmosphere, including
cloud (Kay and Gettelman, 2009; Morrison et al., 2018), surface energy budget (Semmler et al., 2012; Boisvert et al.,
2015; Boisvert and Stroeve, 2015), precipitation (Bintanja and Selten, 2014; Kopec et al., 2016) and large-scale
circulation (Chemke et al., 2019; Kennel and Yulaeva, 2020). Figure 1 depicts the causal relations between key
atmospheric variables and sea ice over the Arctic. The sea ice here represents sea ice coverage and/or sea ice
thickness. Note that the processes a âˆ’ d are well-known atmospheric processes, including cloud microphysics,
thermodynamics, radiation, climate dynamics, which have been studied over the past few decades. The processes
e âˆ’ i are summarized from more recent publications, which are still under investigation by climate scientists.
We will explain processes e âˆ’ i in details in the next paragraph. The arrow e represents the two-way effect between
sea ice and net longwave flux at the surface. Based on global reanalysis (Kapsch et al., 2013; Lee et al., 2017),
surface (Cox et al., 2016) and satellite observations (Huang et al., 2017), as well as model simulations (Kapsch et
al., 2016; Huang et al., 2019a), the downward longwave radiation at the surface dominates surface warming and
therefore enhances sea ice melt in winter and spring. The increase in downward longwave flux is a result of an
increase in cloudiness and moisture in the Arctic Basin, which is caused by enhanced local evaporation or moisture
transport from mid-latitudes (Luo et al., 2017). Positive anomalies of longwave flux in spring and early summer
initiate an earlier melt onset, thereby triggering several feedback mechanisms which amplify melt during the
succeeding months (Kapsch et al., 2016; Huang et al., 2019b). The sea ice melt increases the air temperature

atmospheric processes with changes in Arctic sea ice. Therefore, in this study, we target to provide a more
comprehensive analysis about causality between multiple atmospheric processes and sea ice by applying different
data-driven causality approaches.

According to the information provided, the arrow ""e"" in Figure 1 represents the two-way effect between sea ice and net longwave flux at the surface. It states that the increase in downward longwave flux is a result of an increase in cloudiness and moisture in the Arctic Basin, which is caused by enhanced local evaporation or moisture transport from mid-latitudes. Positive anomalies of longwave flux in spring and early summer initiate an earlier melt onset, thereby triggering several feedback mechanisms which amplify melt during the succeeding months.

Based on this information, we can conclude that net longwave flux at the surface (LW) is influenced by cloudiness and moisture, which are factors that contribute to total cloud water path (CW). Therefore, net longwave flux at the surface (LW) can be considered as a contributing factor to total cloud water path (CW).

Huang et al. Arctic Sea Ice Causality Discovery surface. The downward shortwave flux, however, appears only
important after the melt has started (Kapsch et al., 2013; Huang et al., 2017). Once the surface albedo is
significantly reduced due to sea ice melt, the solar radiation could be absorbed by ocean, which further
accelerates ice melt in late spring and summer (Kay and Gettelman, 2009; Choi et al., 2014; Kapsch et al., 2016).
The feedback between surface net shortwave flux and sea ice, represented by arrow f in Figure 1, has been
confirmed by both model simulations (Kapsch et al., 2016) and satellite observations (Kay and Gettelman, 2009;
Nussbaumer and Pinker, 2012; Choi et al., 2014). The arrows g indicate the interactions between the sea ice variations
and atmospheric dynamical processes. A series of studies demonstrated that recent loss of Arctic sea ice is triggered
by the atmospheric circulation changes such as a tendency toward a dipole pattern in the mean sea level pressure trend
with an increase over the Arctic Ocean and a decrease over Siberia. The Arctic dipole anomaly in summer
(Wang et al., 2009), winter (Watanabe et al., 2006) and spring (Kapsch et al., 2019) produces a strong meridional
wind (v-component) anomaly that drives more sea ice out of the Arctic Ocean. In addition, this dipole anomaly promotes
transport of heat and moisture and thus enhances downward longwave radiation and control the melt onset
(Huang et al., 2019b; Kapsch et al., 2019). Moreover, the changes in cyclone occurrence and/or depth during spring
(Screen et al., 2011) and summer (Simmonds and Rudeva, 2012) have preconditioning effects on the sea ice cover and
exert a strong influence on the amount of sea ice that survives the melt season. A recent study also pointed out that
a stronger anticyclonic circulation over Greenland and the Arctic Ocean in the troposphere may have contributed as much
as 60% to the September sea ice extent decline since 1979, by warming and moistening the lower atmosphere

These conclusions are mainly drawn from in-situ measurements during field campaign (Perovich et al., 2002; Sturm et al.,
2002), global reanalysis products and surface observations (Screen and Simmonds, 2012; Boisvert et al., 2018;

increased 1,000â€“500 hPa thickness in autumn produce anomalous easterley zonal wind component (u-component), especially
over the north of Alaska and Canada. Moreover, a more meridional flow pattern associated with sea ice reduction have
an impact on the mid-latitude weather (Overland and Wang, 2010). These conclusions are mainly drawn from model
simulations (Watanabe et al., 2006; Rinke et al., 2019), reanalysis and observations (Wang et al., 2009; Overland and
Wang, 2010; Kapsch et al., 2019). In addition to radiation, the sensible plus latent heat flux also plays an important
role in the Arctic energy budget. The increase in the downward moisture flux triggers the melting of the sea ice in
spring (Boisvert et al., 2015; Boisvert and Stroeve, 2015; Marcovecchio et al., 2021). Earlier melt onset and loss of
sea ice in the spring enhance warming of the ice-free ocean surface, which in turn leads to an increase of evaporation
from the surface into the atmosphere in the autumn. This positive feedback between heat flux and sea ice, indicated
by arrow h, has been confirmed by satellite observations (Boisvert et al., 2015; Boisvert and Stroeve, 2015) and model
simulations (Huang et al., 2019a) during most months of the year. The arrow i represents the influence of precipitation
on Arctic sea ice variations. Specifically, the magnitude of precipitation accumulating over the sea ice pack largely
determines the depth of the snow layer, which modulates the rate of sea ice growth because of its highly insulating
properties (Sturm et al., 2002). The phase of the precipitation falling on the sea ice pack is also important. As rain,
it can melt, compact, and densify the snowpack, thus reducing the surface albedo and promoting sea ice melt (Perovich
et al., 2002).The recent snowfall decline in summer is essentially caused by changes in precipitation form (snow
turning to rain) with very little influence of decreases in total precipitation, which is a result of
lower-atmospheric warming. Then the loss of snow-on-ice results in a substantial decrease in the surface albedo over
the Arctic Ocean, causing additional surface ice melt by absorbing more solar radiation (Screen and Simmonds, 2012).

CAUSALITY BETWEEN ATMOSPHERIC PROCESSES AND ARCTIC SEA ICE VARIATIONS
Due to the two-way interactions between the atmosphere and sea ice, studying causality between them is a challenging but
important task, which makes it an area of high interest within polar climate community. The sea ice variations can be
caused by different dynamical and thermodynamical processes. Important dynamical processes include anomalous surface
wind (Spreen et al., 2011; Wu et al., 2012), regional atmospheric circulation patterns (Overland and Wang, 2010;
Screen et al., 2018; Rinke et al., 2019) and abnormal storm activities (Simmonds et al., 2008; Simmonds and Keay, 2009;
Screen et al., 2011; Simmonds and Rudeva, 2012; Parkinson and Comiso, 2013; Simmonds and Rudeva, 2014). Cloud (Kapsch
et al., 2013), radiation (Kay and Gettelman, 2009; Choi et al., 2014) and precipitation (Boisvert et al., 2018; Wang
et al., 2019; Marcovecchio et al., 2021) are the important thermodynamic factors controlling Arctic sea ice trends
and variability. On the other hand, sea ice decline in turn exerts large influence on the atmosphere, including
cloud (Kay and Gettelman, 2009; Morrison et al., 2018), surface energy budget (Semmler et al., 2012; Boisvert et al.,
2015; Boisvert and Stroeve, 2015), precipitation (Bintanja and Selten, 2014; Kopec et al., 2016) and large-scale
circulation (Chemke et al., 2019; Kennel and Yulaeva, 2020). Figure 1 depicts the causal relations between key
atmospheric variables and sea ice over the Arctic. The sea ice here represents sea ice coverage and/or sea ice
thickness. Note that the processes a âˆ’ d are well-known atmospheric processes, including cloud microphysics,
thermodynamics, radiation, climate dynamics, which have been studied over the past few decades. The processes
e âˆ’ i are summarized from more recent publications, which are still under investigation by climate scientists.
We will explain processes e âˆ’ i in details in the next paragraph. The arrow e represents the two-way effect between
sea ice and net longwave flux at the surface. Based on global reanalysis (Kapsch et al., 2013; Lee et al., 2017),
surface (Cox et al., 2016) and satellite observations (Huang et al., 2017), as well as model simulations (Kapsch et
al., 2016; Huang et al., 2019a), the downward longwave radiation at the surface dominates surface warming and
therefore enhances sea ice melt in winter and spring. The increase in downward longwave flux is a result of an
increase in cloudiness and moisture in the Arctic Basin, which is caused by enhanced local evaporation or moisture
transport from mid-latitudes (Luo et al., 2017). Positive anomalies of longwave flux in spring and early summer
initiate an earlier melt onset, thereby triggering several feedback mechanisms which amplify melt during the
succeeding months (Kapsch et al., 2016; Huang et al., 2019b). The sea ice melt increases the air temperature

atmospheric processes with changes in Arctic sea ice. Therefore, in this study, we target to provide a more
comprehensive analysis about causality between multiple atmospheric processes and sea ice by applying different
data-driven causality approaches.

Huang et al. Arctic Sea Ice Causality Discovery surface. The downward shortwave flux, however, appears only
important after the melt has started (Kapsch et al., 2013; Huang et al., 2017). Once the surface albedo is
significantly reduced due to sea ice melt, the solar radiation could be absorbed by ocean, which further
accelerates ice melt in late spring and summer (Kay and Gettelman, 2009; Choi et al., 2014; Kapsch et al., 2016).
The feedback between surface net shortwave flux and sea ice, represented by arrow f in Figure 1, has been
confirmed by both model simulations (Kapsch et al., 2016) and satellite observations (Kay and Gettelman, 2009;
Nussbaumer and Pinker, 2012; Choi et al., 2014). The arrows g indicate the interactions between the sea ice variations
and atmospheric dynamical processes. A series of studies demonstrated that recent loss of Arctic sea ice is triggered
by the atmospheric circulation changes such as a tendency toward a dipole pattern in the mean sea level pressure trend
with an increase over the Arctic Ocean and a decrease over Siberia. The Arctic dipole anomaly in summer
(Wang et al., 2009), winter (Watanabe et al., 2006) and spring (Kapsch et al., 2019) produces a strong meridional
wind (v-component) anomaly that drives more sea ice out of the Arctic Ocean. In addition, this dipole anomaly promotes
transport of heat and moisture and thus enhances downward longwave radiation and control the melt onset
(Huang et al., 2019b; Kapsch et al., 2019). Moreover, the changes in cyclone occurrence and/or depth during spring
(Screen et al., 2011) and summer (Simmonds and Rudeva, 2012) have preconditioning effects on the sea ice cover and
exert a strong influence on the amount of sea ice that survives the melt season. A recent study also pointed out that
a stronger anticyclonic circulation over Greenland and the Arctic Ocean in the troposphere may have contributed as much
as 60% to the September sea ice extent decline since 1979, by warming and moistening the lower atmosphere

These conclusions are mainly drawn from in-situ measurements during field campaign (Perovich et al., 2002; Sturm et al.,
2002), global reanalysis products and surface observations (Screen and Simmonds, 2012; Boisvert et al., 2018;
Wang et al., 2019). The higher precipitation and snowfall could result in a thicker snowpack that allows less heat
loss to the atmosphere. More importantly, modeling studies suggest that increases in Arctic precipitation over the
21st century, particularly in late autumn and winter, are due mainly to strongly intensified local surface evaporation
(latent heat flux) (Bintanja and Selten, 2014). Therefore, we believe that Arctic precipitation exerts direct influence
on sea ice variations (arrow i), while sea ice modulates precipitation mainly through sensible plus latent heat flux
(arrows h, b). Among these studies, very few of them have demonstrated the delayed impact of one variable on another.
Specifically, the net shortwave flux at the surface in early summer (Mayâ€“July) is found to enhance sea ice melt with a
lag of 1â€“4 months (Choi et al., 2014). Moreover, the sea ice condition exhibits the delayed impacts on itself, which is
called sea ice anomaly persistence (Guemas et al., 2016; Cruz-GarcÃ­a et al., 2019; Holland et al., 2019). The sea ice
anomaly persistence depends on the predictand (area, extent, volume), region, and the initial and target dates, which
can be varied from a few days to a few years (Guemas et al., 2016). With sea ice anomaly persistence,
there is predictability for the sea ice area in winter but low predictability throughout the rest of the year in
peripheral seas. Based on multiple model simulations, the Labrador Sea stands out among the considered regions,
with sea ice predictability extending up to 1.5 years (Cruz-GarcÃ­a et al., 2019). Note that most of studies mentioned
above determine the changes in one variable, happening before another one, by applying time series analysis and/or
composite analysis based on observations, reanalysis or model output (Perovich et al., 2002; Sturm et al., 2002; Kay
and Gettelman, 2009; Wang et al., 2009; Nussbaumer and Pinker, 2012; Kapsch et al., 2013; Choi et al., 2014; Boisvert

2018; Wang et al., 2019). Among them, some studies use more advanced statistical analysis such as empirical orthogonal
function (Watanabe et al., 2006; Overland and Wang, 2010) and self-organizing map (Kapsch et al., 2019; Rinke et al.,
2019). Other studies assess the causal links through targeted modeling experiments (Bintanja and Selten, 2014; Kapsch
et al., 2016; Ding et al., 2017; Huang et al., 2019a; Cruz-GarcÃ­a et al., 2019), in order to test whether a manipulation
of one variable has an impact on others. And most of the studies focus on relationships between only one or two

(Ding et al., 2017; Huang et al., 2021; Luo et al., 2021). On the other hand, the reduction in Arctic sea ice extent
and increase in open water area in late summer are found to directly contribute to a modification of large-scale

surface (Cox et al., 2016) and satellite observations (Huang et al., 2017), as well as model simulations (Kapsch et
al., 2016; Huang et al., 2019a), the downward longwave radiation at the surface dominates surface warming and
therefore enhances sea ice melt in winter and spring. The increase in downward longwave flux is a result of an
increase in cloudiness and moisture in the Arctic Basin, which is caused by enhanced local evaporation or moisture
transport from mid-latitudes (Luo et al., 2017). Positive anomalies of longwave flux in spring and early summer
initiate an earlier melt onset, thereby triggering several feedback mechanisms which amplify melt during the
succeeding months (Kapsch et al., 2016; Huang et al., 2019b). The sea ice melt increases the air temperature

However, the context does not explicitly mention the relationship between GH and SLP. Therefore, we will use our own knowledge to answer the question.

Geopotential height (GH) is a measure of the height of a pressure level in the atmosphere above a reference level. Sea level pressure (SLP) is the atmospheric pressure at mean sea level. GH and SLP are both atmospheric variables that are influenced by various factors, including temperature, humidity, and wind patterns.

While GH and SLP are related to each other through the vertical structure of the atmosphere, they are not directly causally linked. GH is influenced by temperature and wind patterns, which in turn affect SLP. Changes in GH can indicate the presence of high or low-pressure systems, which can influence SLP. However, GH itself does not directly cause changes in SLP.

Huang et al. Arctic Sea Ice Causality Discovery surface. The downward shortwave flux, however, appears only
important after the melt has started (Kapsch et al., 2013; Huang et al., 2017). Once the surface albedo is
significantly reduced due to sea ice melt, the solar radiation could be absorbed by ocean, which further
accelerates ice melt in late spring and summer (Kay and Gettelman, 2009; Choi et al., 2014; Kapsch et al., 2016).
The feedback between surface net shortwave flux and sea ice, represented by arrow f in Figure 1, has been
confirmed by both model simulations (Kapsch et al., 2016) and satellite observations (Kay and Gettelman, 2009;
Nussbaumer and Pinker, 2012; Choi et al., 2014). The arrows g indicate the interactions between the sea ice variations
and atmospheric dynamical processes. A series of studies demonstrated that recent loss of Arctic sea ice is triggered
by the atmospheric circulation changes such as a tendency toward a dipole pattern in the mean sea level pressure trend
with an increase over the Arctic Ocean and a decrease over Siberia. The Arctic dipole anomaly in summer
(Wang et al., 2009), winter (Watanabe et al., 2006) and spring (Kapsch et al., 2019) produces a strong meridional
wind (v-component) anomaly that drives more sea ice out of the Arctic Ocean. In addition, this dipole anomaly promotes
transport of heat and moisture and thus enhances downward longwave radiation and control the melt onset
(Huang et al., 2019b; Kapsch et al., 2019). Moreover, the changes in cyclone occurrence and/or depth during spring
(Screen et al., 2011) and summer (Simmonds and Rudeva, 2012) have preconditioning effects on the sea ice cover and
exert a strong influence on the amount of sea ice that survives the melt season. A recent study also pointed out that
a stronger anticyclonic circulation over Greenland and the Arctic Ocean in the troposphere may have contributed as much
as 60% to the September sea ice extent decline since 1979, by warming and moistening the lower atmosphere

These conclusions are mainly drawn from in-situ measurements during field campaign (Perovich et al., 2002; Sturm et al.,
2002), global reanalysis products and surface observations (Screen and Simmonds, 2012; Boisvert et al., 2018;
Wang et al., 2019). The higher precipitation and snowfall could result in a thicker snowpack that allows less heat
loss to the atmosphere. More importantly, modeling studies suggest that increases in Arctic precipitation over the
21st century, particularly in late autumn and winter, are due mainly to strongly intensified local surface evaporation
(latent heat flux) (Bintanja and Selten, 2014). Therefore, we believe that Arctic precipitation exerts direct influence
on sea ice variations (arrow i), while sea ice modulates precipitation mainly through sensible plus latent heat flux
(arrows h, b). Among these studies, very few of them have demonstrated the delayed impact of one variable on another.
Specifically, the net shortwave flux at the surface in early summer (Mayâ€“July) is found to enhance sea ice melt with a
lag of 1â€“4 months (Choi et al., 2014). Moreover, the sea ice condition exhibits the delayed impacts on itself, which is
called sea ice anomaly persistence (Guemas et al., 2016; Cruz-GarcÃ­a et al., 2019; Holland et al., 2019). The sea ice
anomaly persistence depends on the predictand (area, extent, volume), region, and the initial and target dates, which
can be varied from a few days to a few years (Guemas et al., 2016). With sea ice anomaly persistence,
there is predictability for the sea ice area in winter but low predictability throughout the rest of the year in
peripheral seas. Based on multiple model simulations, the Labrador Sea stands out among the considered regions,
with sea ice predictability extending up to 1.5 years (Cruz-GarcÃ­a et al., 2019). Note that most of studies mentioned
above determine the changes in one variable, happening before another one, by applying time series analysis and/or
composite analysis based on observations, reanalysis or model output (Perovich et al., 2002; Sturm et al., 2002; Kay
and Gettelman, 2009; Wang et al., 2009; Nussbaumer and Pinker, 2012; Kapsch et al., 2013; Choi et al., 2014; Boisvert

2018; Wang et al., 2019). Among them, some studies use more advanced statistical analysis such as empirical orthogonal
function (Watanabe et al., 2006; Overland and Wang, 2010) and self-organizing map (Kapsch et al., 2019; Rinke et al.,
2019). Other studies assess the causal links through targeted modeling experiments (Bintanja and Selten, 2014; Kapsch
et al., 2016; Ding et al., 2017; Huang et al., 2019a; Cruz-GarcÃ­a et al., 2019), in order to test whether a manipulation
of one variable has an impact on others. And most of the studies focus on relationships between only one or two

(Ding et al., 2017; Huang et al., 2021; Luo et al., 2021). On the other hand, the reduction in Arctic sea ice extent
and increase in open water area in late summer are found to directly contribute to a modification of large-scale

Huang et al. Arctic Sea Ice Causality Discovery circulation patterns in the following autumn through the additional
heat stored in the Arctic Ocean and released to the atmosphere during the autumn (Overland and Wang, 2010). The
increased 1,000â€“500 hPa thickness in autumn produce anomalous easterley zonal wind component (u-component), especially
over the north of Alaska and Canada. Moreover, a more meridional flow pattern associated with sea ice reduction have
an impact on the mid-latitude weather (Overland and Wang, 2010). These conclusions are mainly drawn from model
simulations (Watanabe et al., 2006; Rinke et al., 2019), reanalysis and observations (Wang et al., 2009; Overland and
Wang, 2010; Kapsch et al., 2019). In addition to radiation, the sensible plus latent heat flux also plays an important
role in the Arctic energy budget. The increase in the downward moisture flux triggers the melting of the sea ice in
spring (Boisvert et al., 2015; Boisvert and Stroeve, 2015; Marcovecchio et al., 2021). Earlier melt onset and loss of
sea ice in the spring enhance warming of the ice-free ocean surface, which in turn leads to an increase of evaporation
from the surface into the atmosphere in the autumn. This positive feedback between heat flux and sea ice, indicated
by arrow h, has been confirmed by satellite observations (Boisvert et al., 2015; Boisvert and Stroeve, 2015) and model
simulations (Huang et al., 2019a) during most months of the year. The arrow i represents the influence of precipitation
on Arctic sea ice variations. Specifically, the magnitude of precipitation accumulating over the sea ice pack largely
determines the depth of the snow layer, which modulates the rate of sea ice growth because of its highly insulating
properties (Sturm et al., 2002). The phase of the precipitation falling on the sea ice pack is also important. As rain,
it can melt, compact, and densify the snowpack, thus reducing the surface albedo and promoting sea ice melt (Perovich
et al., 2002).The recent snowfall decline in summer is essentially caused by changes in precipitation form (snow
turning to rain) with very little influence of decreases in total precipitation, which is a result of
lower-atmospheric warming. Then the loss of snow-on-ice results in a substantial decrease in the surface albedo over
the Arctic Ocean, causing additional surface ice melt by absorbing more solar radiation (Screen and Simmonds, 2012).

CAUSALITY BETWEEN ATMOSPHERIC PROCESSES AND ARCTIC SEA ICE VARIATIONS
Due to the two-way interactions between the atmosphere and sea ice, studying causality between them is a challenging but
important task, which makes it an area of high interest within polar climate community. The sea ice variations can be
caused by different dynamical and thermodynamical processes. Important dynamical processes include anomalous surface
wind (Spreen et al., 2011; Wu et al., 2012), regional atmospheric circulation patterns (Overland and Wang, 2010;
Screen et al., 2018; Rinke et al., 2019) and abnormal storm activities (Simmonds et al., 2008; Simmonds and Keay, 2009;
Screen et al., 2011; Simmonds and Rudeva, 2012; Parkinson and Comiso, 2013; Simmonds and Rudeva, 2014). Cloud (Kapsch
et al., 2013), radiation (Kay and Gettelman, 2009; Choi et al., 2014) and precipitation (Boisvert et al., 2018; Wang
et al., 2019; Marcovecchio et al., 2021) are the important thermodynamic factors controlling Arctic sea ice trends
and variability. On the other hand, sea ice decline in turn exerts large influence on the atmosphere, including
cloud (Kay and Gettelman, 2009; Morrison et al., 2018), surface energy budget (Semmler et al., 2012; Boisvert et al.,
2015; Boisvert and Stroeve, 2015), precipitation (Bintanja and Selten, 2014; Kopec et al., 2016) and large-scale

Huang et al. Arctic Sea Ice Causality Discovery surface. The downward shortwave flux, however, appears only
important after the melt has started (Kapsch et al., 2013; Huang et al., 2017). Once the surface albedo is
significantly reduced due to sea ice melt, the solar radiation could be absorbed by ocean, which further
accelerates ice melt in late spring and summer (Kay and Gettelman, 2009; Choi et al., 2014; Kapsch et al., 2016).
The feedback between surface net shortwave flux and sea ice, represented by arrow f in Figure 1, has been
confirmed by both model simulations (Kapsch et al., 2016) and satellite observations (Kay and Gettelman, 2009;
Nussbaumer and Pinker, 2012; Choi et al., 2014). The arrows g indicate the interactions between the sea ice variations
and atmospheric dynamical processes. A series of studies demonstrated that recent loss of Arctic sea ice is triggered
by the atmospheric circulation changes such as a tendency toward a dipole pattern in the mean sea level pressure trend
with an increase over the Arctic Ocean and a decrease over Siberia. The Arctic dipole anomaly in summer
(Wang et al., 2009), winter (Watanabe et al., 2006) and spring (Kapsch et al., 2019) produces a strong meridional
wind (v-component) anomaly that drives more sea ice out of the Arctic Ocean. In addition, this dipole anomaly promotes
transport of heat and moisture and thus enhances downward longwave radiation and control the melt onset
(Huang et al., 2019b; Kapsch et al., 2019). Moreover, the changes in cyclone occurrence and/or depth during spring
(Screen et al., 2011) and summer (Simmonds and Rudeva, 2012) have preconditioning effects on the sea ice cover and
exert a strong influence on the amount of sea ice that survives the melt season. A recent study also pointed out that
a stronger anticyclonic circulation over Greenland and the Arctic Ocean in the troposphere may have contributed as much
as 60% to the September sea ice extent decline since 1979, by warming and moistening the lower atmosphere

These conclusions are mainly drawn from in-situ measurements during field campaign (Perovich et al., 2002; Sturm et al.,
2002), global reanalysis products and surface observations (Screen and Simmonds, 2012; Boisvert et al., 2018;
Wang et al., 2019). The higher precipitation and snowfall could result in a thicker snowpack that allows less heat
loss to the atmosphere. More importantly, modeling studies suggest that increases in Arctic precipitation over the
21st century, particularly in late autumn and winter, are due mainly to strongly intensified local surface evaporation
(latent heat flux) (Bintanja and Selten, 2014). Therefore, we believe that Arctic precipitation exerts direct influence
on sea ice variations (arrow i), while sea ice modulates precipitation mainly through sensible plus latent heat flux
(arrows h, b). Among these studies, very few of them have demonstrated the delayed impact of one variable on another.
Specifically, the net shortwave flux at the surface in early summer (Mayâ€“July) is found to enhance sea ice melt with a
lag of 1â€“4 months (Choi et al., 2014). Moreover, the sea ice condition exhibits the delayed impacts on itself, which is
called sea ice anomaly persistence (Guemas et al., 2016; Cruz-GarcÃ­a et al., 2019; Holland et al., 2019). The sea ice
anomaly persistence depends on the predictand (area, extent, volume), region, and the initial and target dates, which
can be varied from a few days to a few years (Guemas et al., 2016). With sea ice anomaly persistence,
there is predictability for the sea ice area in winter but low predictability throughout the rest of the year in
peripheral seas. Based on multiple model simulations, the Labrador Sea stands out among the considered regions,
with sea ice predictability extending up to 1.5 years (Cruz-GarcÃ­a et al., 2019). Note that most of studies mentioned
above determine the changes in one variable, happening before another one, by applying time series analysis and/or
composite analysis based on observations, reanalysis or model output (Perovich et al., 2002; Sturm et al., 2002; Kay
and Gettelman, 2009; Wang et al., 2009; Nussbaumer and Pinker, 2012; Kapsch et al., 2013; Choi et al., 2014; Boisvert

2018; Wang et al., 2019). Among them, some studies use more advanced statistical analysis such as empirical orthogonal
function (Watanabe et al., 2006; Overland and Wang, 2010) and self-organizing map (Kapsch et al., 2019; Rinke et al.,
2019). Other studies assess the causal links through targeted modeling experiments (Bintanja and Selten, 2014; Kapsch
et al., 2016; Ding et al., 2017; Huang et al., 2019a; Cruz-GarcÃ­a et al., 2019), in order to test whether a manipulation
of one variable has an impact on others. And most of the studies focus on relationships between only one or two

(Ding et al., 2017; Huang et al., 2021; Luo et al., 2021). On the other hand, the reduction in Arctic sea ice extent
and increase in open water area in late summer are found to directly contribute to a modification of large-scale

Huang et al. Arctic Sea Ice Causality Discovery circulation patterns in the following autumn through the additional
heat stored in the Arctic Ocean and released to the atmosphere during the autumn (Overland and Wang, 2010). The
increased 1,000â€“500 hPa thickness in autumn produce anomalous easterley zonal wind component (u-component), especially
over the north of Alaska and Canada. Moreover, a more meridional flow pattern associated with sea ice reduction have
an impact on the mid-latitude weather (Overland and Wang, 2010). These conclusions are mainly drawn from model
simulations (Watanabe et al., 2006; Rinke et al., 2019), reanalysis and observations (Wang et al., 2009; Overland and
Wang, 2010; Kapsch et al., 2019). In addition to radiation, the sensible plus latent heat flux also plays an important
role in the Arctic energy budget. The increase in the downward moisture flux triggers the melting of the sea ice in
spring (Boisvert et al., 2015; Boisvert and Stroeve, 2015; Marcovecchio et al., 2021). Earlier melt onset and loss of
sea ice in the spring enhance warming of the ice-free ocean surface, which in turn leads to an increase of evaporation
from the surface into the atmosphere in the autumn. This positive feedback between heat flux and sea ice, indicated
by arrow h, has been confirmed by satellite observations (Boisvert et al., 2015; Boisvert and Stroeve, 2015) and model
simulations (Huang et al., 2019a) during most months of the year. The arrow i represents the influence of precipitation
on Arctic sea ice variations. Specifically, the magnitude of precipitation accumulating over the sea ice pack largely
determines the depth of the snow layer, which modulates the rate of sea ice growth because of its highly insulating
properties (Sturm et al., 2002). The phase of the precipitation falling on the sea ice pack is also important. As rain,
it can melt, compact, and densify the snowpack, thus reducing the surface albedo and promoting sea ice melt (Perovich
et al., 2002).The recent snowfall decline in summer is essentially caused by changes in precipitation form (snow
turning to rain) with very little influence of decreases in total precipitation, which is a result of
lower-atmospheric warming. Then the loss of snow-on-ice results in a substantial decrease in the surface albedo over
the Arctic Ocean, causing additional surface ice melt by absorbing more solar radiation (Screen and Simmonds, 2012).

CAUSALITY BETWEEN ATMOSPHERIC PROCESSES AND ARCTIC SEA ICE VARIATIONS
Due to the two-way interactions between the atmosphere and sea ice, studying causality between them is a challenging but
important task, which makes it an area of high interest within polar climate community. The sea ice variations can be
caused by different dynamical and thermodynamical processes. Important dynamical processes include anomalous surface
wind (Spreen et al., 2011; Wu et al., 2012), regional atmospheric circulation patterns (Overland and Wang, 2010;
Screen et al., 2018; Rinke et al., 2019) and abnormal storm activities (Simmonds et al., 2008; Simmonds and Keay, 2009;
Screen et al., 2011; Simmonds and Rudeva, 2012; Parkinson and Comiso, 2013; Simmonds and Rudeva, 2014). Cloud (Kapsch
et al., 2013), radiation (Kay and Gettelman, 2009; Choi et al., 2014) and precipitation (Boisvert et al., 2018; Wang
et al., 2019; Marcovecchio et al., 2021) are the important thermodynamic factors controlling Arctic sea ice trends
and variability. On the other hand, sea ice decline in turn exerts large influence on the atmosphere, including
cloud (Kay and Gettelman, 2009; Morrison et al., 2018), surface energy budget (Semmler et al., 2012; Boisvert et al.,
2015; Boisvert and Stroeve, 2015), precipitation (Bintanja and Selten, 2014; Kopec et al., 2016) and large-scale
circulation (Chemke et al., 2019; Kennel and Yulaeva, 2020). Figure 1 depicts the causal relations between key
atmospheric variables and sea ice over the Arctic. The sea ice here represents sea ice coverage and/or sea ice
thickness. Note that the processes a âˆ’ d are well-known atmospheric processes, including cloud microphysics,
thermodynamics, radiation, climate dynamics, which have been studied over the past few decades. The processes
e âˆ’ i are summarized from more recent publications, which are still under investigation by climate scientists.
We will explain processes e âˆ’ i in details in the next paragraph. The arrow e represents the two-way effect between
sea ice and net longwave flux at the surface. Based on global reanalysis (Kapsch et al., 2013; Lee et al., 2017),
surface (Cox et al., 2016) and satellite observations (Huang et al., 2017), as well as model simulations (Kapsch et
al., 2016; Huang et al., 2019a), the downward longwave radiation at the surface dominates surface warming and
therefore enhances sea ice melt in winter and spring. The increase in downward longwave flux is a result of an
increase in cloudiness and moisture in the Arctic Basin, which is caused by enhanced local evaporation or moisture
transport from mid-latitudes (Luo et al., 2017). Positive anomalies of longwave flux in spring and early summer
initiate an earlier melt onset, thereby triggering several feedback mechanisms which amplify melt during the
succeeding months (Kapsch et al., 2016; Huang et al., 2019b). The sea ice melt increases the air temperature

atmospheric processes with changes in Arctic sea ice. Therefore, in this study, we target to provide a more
comprehensive analysis about causality between multiple atmospheric processes and sea ice by applying different
data-driven causality approaches.

39,"To determine if geopotential height (GH) is a direct cause of zonal (u-component) wind at 10 m (u10m), we need to examine the information provided in the context.

The context does not explicitly mention the relationship between geopotential height and zonal wind at 10 m. However, it does provide information about the causal relationships between various atmospheric variables and sea ice in the Arctic. It mentions that anomalous surface wind, regional atmospheric circulation patterns, and abnormal storm activities are important dynamical processes that can affect Arctic sea ice. It also states that cloud, radiation, and precipitation are important thermodynamic factors controlling Arctic sea ice trends and variability.

Based on this information, we can infer that geopotential height, which is related to atmospheric circulation patterns, could indirectly influence zonal wind at 10 m. Changes in geopotential height can affect the overall atmospheric circulation, which in turn can impact the zonal wind at 10 m.

Therefore, the answer to the question ""Is geopotential height (GH) a direct cause of zonal (u-component) wind at 10 m (u10m)?"" is <Answer>no</Answer>.

2002), global reanalysis products and surface observations (Screen and Simmonds, 2012; Boisvert et al., 2018;
Wang et al., 2019). The higher precipitation and snowfall could result in a thicker snowpack that allows less heat
loss to the atmosphere. More importantly, modeling studies suggest that increases in Arctic precipitation over the
21st century, particularly in late autumn and winter, are due mainly to strongly intensified local surface evaporation
(latent heat flux) (Bintanja and Selten, 2014). Therefore, we believe that Arctic precipitation exerts direct influence
on sea ice variations (arrow i), while sea ice modulates precipitation mainly through sensible plus latent heat flux
(arrows h, b). Among these studies, very few of them have demonstrated the delayed impact of one variable on another.
Specifically, the net shortwave flux at the surface in early summer (Mayâ€“July) is found to enhance sea ice melt with a
lag of 1â€“4 months (Choi et al., 2014). Moreover, the sea ice condition exhibits the delayed impacts on itself, which is
called sea ice anomaly persistence (Guemas et al., 2016; Cruz-GarcÃ­a et al., 2019; Holland et al., 2019). The sea ice
anomaly persistence depends on the predictand (area, extent, volume), region, and the initial and target dates, which
can be varied from a few days to a few years (Guemas et al., 2016). With sea ice anomaly persistence,
there is predictability for the sea ice area in winter but low predictability throughout the rest of the year in
peripheral seas. Based on multiple model simulations, the Labrador Sea stands out among the considered regions,
with sea ice predictability extending up to 1.5 years (Cruz-GarcÃ­a et al., 2019). Note that most of studies mentioned
above determine the changes in one variable, happening before another one, by applying time series analysis and/or
composite analysis based on observations, reanalysis or model output (Perovich et al., 2002; Sturm et al., 2002; Kay
and Gettelman, 2009; Wang et al., 2009; Nussbaumer and Pinker, 2012; Kapsch et al., 2013; Choi et al., 2014; Boisvert

2018; Wang et al., 2019). Among them, some studies use more advanced statistical analysis such as empirical orthogonal
function (Watanabe et al., 2006; Overland and Wang, 2010) and self-organizing map (Kapsch et al., 2019; Rinke et al.,
2019). Other studies assess the causal links through targeted modeling experiments (Bintanja and Selten, 2014; Kapsch
et al., 2016; Ding et al., 2017; Huang et al., 2019a; Cruz-GarcÃ­a et al., 2019), in order to test whether a manipulation
of one variable has an impact on others. And most of the studies focus on relationships between only one or two

(Ding et al., 2017; Huang et al., 2021; Luo et al., 2021). On the other hand, the reduction in Arctic sea ice extent
and increase in open water area in late summer are found to directly contribute to a modification of large-scale

Huang et al. Arctic Sea Ice Causality Discovery circulation patterns in the following autumn through the additional
heat stored in the Arctic Ocean and released to the atmosphere during the autumn (Overland and Wang, 2010). The
increased 1,000â€“500 hPa thickness in autumn produce anomalous easterley zonal wind component (u-component), especially
over the north of Alaska and Canada. Moreover, a more meridional flow pattern associated with sea ice reduction have
an impact on the mid-latitude weather (Overland and Wang, 2010). These conclusions are mainly drawn from model
simulations (Watanabe et al., 2006; Rinke et al., 2019), reanalysis and observations (Wang et al., 2009; Overland and
Wang, 2010; Kapsch et al., 2019). In addition to radiation, the sensible plus latent heat flux also plays an important
role in the Arctic energy budget. The increase in the downward moisture flux triggers the melting of the sea ice in
spring (Boisvert et al., 2015; Boisvert and Stroeve, 2015; Marcovecchio et al., 2021). Earlier melt onset and loss of
sea ice in the spring enhance warming of the ice-free ocean surface, which in turn leads to an increase of evaporation
from the surface into the atmosphere in the autumn. This positive feedback between heat flux and sea ice, indicated
by arrow h, has been confirmed by satellite observations (Boisvert et al., 2015; Boisvert and Stroeve, 2015) and model
simulations (Huang et al., 2019a) during most months of the year. The arrow i represents the influence of precipitation
on Arctic sea ice variations. Specifically, the magnitude of precipitation accumulating over the sea ice pack largely
determines the depth of the snow layer, which modulates the rate of sea ice growth because of its highly insulating
properties (Sturm et al., 2002). The phase of the precipitation falling on the sea ice pack is also important. As rain,
it can melt, compact, and densify the snowpack, thus reducing the surface albedo and promoting sea ice melt (Perovich
et al., 2002).The recent snowfall decline in summer is essentially caused by changes in precipitation form (snow
turning to rain) with very little influence of decreases in total precipitation, which is a result of
lower-atmospheric warming. Then the loss of snow-on-ice results in a substantial decrease in the surface albedo over
the Arctic Ocean, causing additional surface ice melt by absorbing more solar radiation (Screen and Simmonds, 2012).

CAUSALITY BETWEEN ATMOSPHERIC PROCESSES AND ARCTIC SEA ICE VARIATIONS
Due to the two-way interactions between the atmosphere and sea ice, studying causality between them is a challenging but
important task, which makes it an area of high interest within polar climate community. The sea ice variations can be
caused by different dynamical and thermodynamical processes. Important dynamical processes include anomalous surface
wind (Spreen et al., 2011; Wu et al., 2012), regional atmospheric circulation patterns (Overland and Wang, 2010;
Screen et al., 2018; Rinke et al., 2019) and abnormal storm activities (Simmonds et al., 2008; Simmonds and Keay, 2009;
Screen et al., 2011; Simmonds and Rudeva, 2012; Parkinson and Comiso, 2013; Simmonds and Rudeva, 2014). Cloud (Kapsch
et al., 2013), radiation (Kay and Gettelman, 2009; Choi et al., 2014) and precipitation (Boisvert et al., 2018; Wang
et al., 2019; Marcovecchio et al., 2021) are the important thermodynamic factors controlling Arctic sea ice trends
and variability. On the other hand, sea ice decline in turn exerts large influence on the atmosphere, including
cloud (Kay and Gettelman, 2009; Morrison et al., 2018), surface energy budget (Semmler et al., 2012; Boisvert et al.,
2015; Boisvert and Stroeve, 2015), precipitation (Bintanja and Selten, 2014; Kopec et al., 2016) and large-scale
circulation (Chemke et al., 2019; Kennel and Yulaeva, 2020). Figure 1 depicts the causal relations between key
atmospheric variables and sea ice over the Arctic. The sea ice here represents sea ice coverage and/or sea ice
thickness. Note that the processes a âˆ’ d are well-known atmospheric processes, including cloud microphysics,
thermodynamics, radiation, climate dynamics, which have been studied over the past few decades. The processes
e âˆ’ i are summarized from more recent publications, which are still under investigation by climate scientists.
We will explain processes e âˆ’ i in details in the next paragraph. The arrow e represents the two-way effect between
sea ice and net longwave flux at the surface. Based on global reanalysis (Kapsch et al., 2013; Lee et al., 2017),
surface (Cox et al., 2016) and satellite observations (Huang et al., 2017), as well as model simulations (Kapsch et
al., 2016; Huang et al., 2019a), the downward longwave radiation at the surface dominates surface warming and
therefore enhances sea ice melt in winter and spring. The increase in downward longwave flux is a result of an
increase in cloudiness and moisture in the Arctic Basin, which is caused by enhanced local evaporation or moisture
transport from mid-latitudes (Luo et al., 2017). Positive anomalies of longwave flux in spring and early summer
initiate an earlier melt onset, thereby triggering several feedback mechanisms which amplify melt during the
succeeding months (Kapsch et al., 2016; Huang et al., 2019b). The sea ice melt increases the air temperature

atmospheric processes with changes in Arctic sea ice. Therefore, in this study, we target to provide a more
comprehensive analysis about causality between multiple atmospheric processes and sea ice by applying different
data-driven causality approaches.

According to the information provided, geopotential height (GH) is not explicitly mentioned as a direct cause of sea ice coverage and/or sea ice thickness. The context mentions several atmospheric variables that are known to influence sea ice, such as relative humidity (RH), sea level pressure (SLP), wind (u10m and v10m), heat flux (HFLX), precipitation (Precip), cloud water path (CW), cloud cover (CC), and net shortwave and longwave flux at the surface (SW and LW).

Huang et al. Arctic Sea Ice Causality Discovery surface. The downward shortwave flux, however, appears only
important after the melt has started (Kapsch et al., 2013; Huang et al., 2017). Once the surface albedo is
significantly reduced due to sea ice melt, the solar radiation could be absorbed by ocean, which further
accelerates ice melt in late spring and summer (Kay and Gettelman, 2009; Choi et al., 2014; Kapsch et al., 2016).
The feedback between surface net shortwave flux and sea ice, represented by arrow f in Figure 1, has been
confirmed by both model simulations (Kapsch et al., 2016) and satellite observations (Kay and Gettelman, 2009;
Nussbaumer and Pinker, 2012; Choi et al., 2014). The arrows g indicate the interactions between the sea ice variations
and atmospheric dynamical processes. A series of studies demonstrated that recent loss of Arctic sea ice is triggered
by the atmospheric circulation changes such as a tendency toward a dipole pattern in the mean sea level pressure trend
with an increase over the Arctic Ocean and a decrease over Siberia. The Arctic dipole anomaly in summer
(Wang et al., 2009), winter (Watanabe et al., 2006) and spring (Kapsch et al., 2019) produces a strong meridional
wind (v-component) anomaly that drives more sea ice out of the Arctic Ocean. In addition, this dipole anomaly promotes
transport of heat and moisture and thus enhances downward longwave radiation and control the melt onset
(Huang et al., 2019b; Kapsch et al., 2019). Moreover, the changes in cyclone occurrence and/or depth during spring
(Screen et al., 2011) and summer (Simmonds and Rudeva, 2012) have preconditioning effects on the sea ice cover and
exert a strong influence on the amount of sea ice that survives the melt season. A recent study also pointed out that
a stronger anticyclonic circulation over Greenland and the Arctic Ocean in the troposphere may have contributed as much
as 60% to the September sea ice extent decline since 1979, by warming and moistening the lower atmosphere

These conclusions are mainly drawn from in-situ measurements during field campaign (Perovich et al., 2002; Sturm et al.,

Huang et al. Arctic Sea Ice Causality Discovery circulation patterns in the following autumn through the additional
heat stored in the Arctic Ocean and released to the atmosphere during the autumn (Overland and Wang, 2010). The
increased 1,000â€“500 hPa thickness in autumn produce anomalous easterley zonal wind component (u-component), especially
over the north of Alaska and Canada. Moreover, a more meridional flow pattern associated with sea ice reduction have
an impact on the mid-latitude weather (Overland and Wang, 2010). These conclusions are mainly drawn from model
simulations (Watanabe et al., 2006; Rinke et al., 2019), reanalysis and observations (Wang et al., 2009; Overland and
Wang, 2010; Kapsch et al., 2019). In addition to radiation, the sensible plus latent heat flux also plays an important
role in the Arctic energy budget. The increase in the downward moisture flux triggers the melting of the sea ice in
spring (Boisvert et al., 2015; Boisvert and Stroeve, 2015; Marcovecchio et al., 2021). Earlier melt onset and loss of
sea ice in the spring enhance warming of the ice-free ocean surface, which in turn leads to an increase of evaporation
from the surface into the atmosphere in the autumn. This positive feedback between heat flux and sea ice, indicated
by arrow h, has been confirmed by satellite observations (Boisvert et al., 2015; Boisvert and Stroeve, 2015) and model
simulations (Huang et al., 2019a) during most months of the year. The arrow i represents the influence of precipitation
on Arctic sea ice variations. Specifically, the magnitude of precipitation accumulating over the sea ice pack largely
determines the depth of the snow layer, which modulates the rate of sea ice growth because of its highly insulating
properties (Sturm et al., 2002). The phase of the precipitation falling on the sea ice pack is also important. As rain,
it can melt, compact, and densify the snowpack, thus reducing the surface albedo and promoting sea ice melt (Perovich
et al., 2002).The recent snowfall decline in summer is essentially caused by changes in precipitation form (snow
turning to rain) with very little influence of decreases in total precipitation, which is a result of
lower-atmospheric warming. Then the loss of snow-on-ice results in a substantial decrease in the surface albedo over
the Arctic Ocean, causing additional surface ice melt by absorbing more solar radiation (Screen and Simmonds, 2012).

CAUSALITY BETWEEN ATMOSPHERIC PROCESSES AND ARCTIC SEA ICE VARIATIONS
Due to the two-way interactions between the atmosphere and sea ice, studying causality between them is a challenging but
important task, which makes it an area of high interest within polar climate community. The sea ice variations can be
caused by different dynamical and thermodynamical processes. Important dynamical processes include anomalous surface
wind (Spreen et al., 2011; Wu et al., 2012), regional atmospheric circulation patterns (Overland and Wang, 2010;
Screen et al., 2018; Rinke et al., 2019) and abnormal storm activities (Simmonds et al., 2008; Simmonds and Keay, 2009;
Screen et al., 2011; Simmonds and Rudeva, 2012; Parkinson and Comiso, 2013; Simmonds and Rudeva, 2014). Cloud (Kapsch
et al., 2013), radiation (Kay and Gettelman, 2009; Choi et al., 2014) and precipitation (Boisvert et al., 2018; Wang
et al., 2019; Marcovecchio et al., 2021) are the important thermodynamic factors controlling Arctic sea ice trends
and variability. On the other hand, sea ice decline in turn exerts large influence on the atmosphere, including
cloud (Kay and Gettelman, 2009; Morrison et al., 2018), surface energy budget (Semmler et al., 2012; Boisvert et al.,
2015; Boisvert and Stroeve, 2015), precipitation (Bintanja and Selten, 2014; Kopec et al., 2016) and large-scale
circulation (Chemke et al., 2019; Kennel and Yulaeva, 2020). Figure 1 depicts the causal relations between key
atmospheric variables and sea ice over the Arctic. The sea ice here represents sea ice coverage and/or sea ice
thickness. Note that the processes a âˆ’ d are well-known atmospheric processes, including cloud microphysics,
thermodynamics, radiation, climate dynamics, which have been studied over the past few decades. The processes
e âˆ’ i are summarized from more recent publications, which are still under investigation by climate scientists.
We will explain processes e âˆ’ i in details in the next paragraph. The arrow e represents the two-way effect between
sea ice and net longwave flux at the surface. Based on global reanalysis (Kapsch et al., 2013; Lee et al., 2017),
surface (Cox et al., 2016) and satellite observations (Huang et al., 2017), as well as model simulations (Kapsch et
al., 2016; Huang et al., 2019a), the downward longwave radiation at the surface dominates surface warming and
therefore enhances sea ice melt in winter and spring. The increase in downward longwave flux is a result of an
increase in cloudiness and moisture in the Arctic Basin, which is caused by enhanced local evaporation or moisture
transport from mid-latitudes (Luo et al., 2017). Positive anomalies of longwave flux in spring and early summer
initiate an earlier melt onset, thereby triggering several feedback mechanisms which amplify melt during the
succeeding months (Kapsch et al., 2016; Huang et al., 2019b). The sea ice melt increases the air temperature

atmospheric processes with changes in Arctic sea ice. Therefore, in this study, we target to provide a more
comprehensive analysis about causality between multiple atmospheric processes and sea ice by applying different
data-driven causality approaches.

Huang et al. Arctic Sea Ice Causality Discovery surface. The downward shortwave flux, however, appears only
important after the melt has started (Kapsch et al., 2013; Huang et al., 2017). Once the surface albedo is
significantly reduced due to sea ice melt, the solar radiation could be absorbed by ocean, which further
accelerates ice melt in late spring and summer (Kay and Gettelman, 2009; Choi et al., 2014; Kapsch et al., 2016).
The feedback between surface net shortwave flux and sea ice, represented by arrow f in Figure 1, has been
confirmed by both model simulations (Kapsch et al., 2016) and satellite observations (Kay and Gettelman, 2009;
Nussbaumer and Pinker, 2012; Choi et al., 2014). The arrows g indicate the interactions between the sea ice variations
and atmospheric dynamical processes. A series of studies demonstrated that recent loss of Arctic sea ice is triggered
by the atmospheric circulation changes such as a tendency toward a dipole pattern in the mean sea level pressure trend
with an increase over the Arctic Ocean and a decrease over Siberia. The Arctic dipole anomaly in summer
(Wang et al., 2009), winter (Watanabe et al., 2006) and spring (Kapsch et al., 2019) produces a strong meridional
wind (v-component) anomaly that drives more sea ice out of the Arctic Ocean. In addition, this dipole anomaly promotes
transport of heat and moisture and thus enhances downward longwave radiation and control the melt onset
(Huang et al., 2019b; Kapsch et al., 2019). Moreover, the changes in cyclone occurrence and/or depth during spring
(Screen et al., 2011) and summer (Simmonds and Rudeva, 2012) have preconditioning effects on the sea ice cover and
exert a strong influence on the amount of sea ice that survives the melt season. A recent study also pointed out that
a stronger anticyclonic circulation over Greenland and the Arctic Ocean in the troposphere may have contributed as much
as 60% to the September sea ice extent decline since 1979, by warming and moistening the lower atmosphere

These conclusions are mainly drawn from in-situ measurements during field campaign (Perovich et al., 2002; Sturm et al.,
2002), global reanalysis products and surface observations (Screen and Simmonds, 2012; Boisvert et al., 2018;
Wang et al., 2019). The higher precipitation and snowfall could result in a thicker snowpack that allows less heat
loss to the atmosphere. More importantly, modeling studies suggest that increases in Arctic precipitation over the
21st century, particularly in late autumn and winter, are due mainly to strongly intensified local surface evaporation
(latent heat flux) (Bintanja and Selten, 2014). Therefore, we believe that Arctic precipitation exerts direct influence
on sea ice variations (arrow i), while sea ice modulates precipitation mainly through sensible plus latent heat flux
(arrows h, b). Among these studies, very few of them have demonstrated the delayed impact of one variable on another.
Specifically, the net shortwave flux at the surface in early summer (Mayâ€“July) is found to enhance sea ice melt with a
lag of 1â€“4 months (Choi et al., 2014). Moreover, the sea ice condition exhibits the delayed impacts on itself, which is
called sea ice anomaly persistence (Guemas et al., 2016; Cruz-GarcÃ­a et al., 2019; Holland et al., 2019). The sea ice
anomaly persistence depends on the predictand (area, extent, volume), region, and the initial and target dates, which
can be varied from a few days to a few years (Guemas et al., 2016). With sea ice anomaly persistence,
there is predictability for the sea ice area in winter but low predictability throughout the rest of the year in
peripheral seas. Based on multiple model simulations, the Labrador Sea stands out among the considered regions,
with sea ice predictability extending up to 1.5 years (Cruz-GarcÃ­a et al., 2019). Note that most of studies mentioned
above determine the changes in one variable, happening before another one, by applying time series analysis and/or
composite analysis based on observations, reanalysis or model output (Perovich et al., 2002; Sturm et al., 2002; Kay
and Gettelman, 2009; Wang et al., 2009; Nussbaumer and Pinker, 2012; Kapsch et al., 2013; Choi et al., 2014; Boisvert
et al., 2015; Boisvert and Stroeve, 2015; Cox et al., 2016; Huang et al., 2017; Huang et al., 2019b; Boisvert et al.,
2018; Wang et al., 2019). Among them, some studies use more advanced statistical analysis such as empirical orthogonal
function (Watanabe et al., 2006; Overland and Wang, 2010) and self-organizing map (Kapsch et al., 2019; Rinke et al.,
2019). Other studies assess the causal links through targeted modeling experiments (Bintanja and Selten, 2014; Kapsch
et al., 2016; Ding et al., 2017; Huang et al., 2019a; Cruz-GarcÃ­a et al., 2019), in order to test whether a manipulation
of one variable has an impact on others. And most of the studies focus on relationships between only one or two

(Ding et al., 2017; Huang et al., 2021; Luo et al., 2021). On the other hand, the reduction in Arctic sea ice extent
and increase in open water area in late summer are found to directly contribute to a modification of large-scale

heat stored in the Arctic Ocean and released to the atmosphere during the autumn (Overland and Wang, 2010). The
increased 1,000â€“500 hPa thickness in autumn produce anomalous easterley zonal wind component (u-component), especially
over the north of Alaska and Canada. Moreover, a more meridional flow pattern associated with sea ice reduction have
an impact on the mid-latitude weather (Overland and Wang, 2010). These conclusions are mainly drawn from model
simulations (Watanabe et al., 2006; Rinke et al., 2019), reanalysis and observations (Wang et al., 2009; Overland and

role in the Arctic energy budget. The increase in the downward moisture flux triggers the melting of the sea ice in
spring (Boisvert et al., 2015; Boisvert and Stroeve, 2015; Marcovecchio et al., 2021). Earlier melt onset and loss of
sea ice in the spring enhance warming of the ice-free ocean surface, which in turn leads to an increase of evaporation
from the surface into the atmosphere in the autumn. This positive feedback between heat flux and sea ice, indicated

surface (Cox et al., 2016) and satellite observations (Huang et al., 2017), as well as model simulations (Kapsch et
al., 2016; Huang et al., 2019a), the downward longwave radiation at the surface dominates surface warming and
therefore enhances sea ice melt in winter and spring. The increase in downward longwave flux is a result of an
increase in cloudiness and moisture in the Arctic Basin, which is caused by enhanced local evaporation or moisture
transport from mid-latitudes (Luo et al., 2017). Positive anomalies of longwave flux in spring and early summer
initiate an earlier melt onset, thereby triggering several feedback mechanisms which amplify melt during the
succeeding months (Kapsch et al., 2016; Huang et al., 2019b). The sea ice melt increases the air temperature

Huang et al. Arctic Sea Ice Causality Discovery surface. The downward shortwave flux, however, appears only
important after the melt has started (Kapsch et al., 2013; Huang et al., 2017). Once the surface albedo is
significantly reduced due to sea ice melt, the solar radiation could be absorbed by ocean, which further
accelerates ice melt in late spring and summer (Kay and Gettelman, 2009; Choi et al., 2014; Kapsch et al., 2016).
The feedback between surface net shortwave flux and sea ice, represented by arrow f in Figure 1, has been
confirmed by both model simulations (Kapsch et al., 2016) and satellite observations (Kay and Gettelman, 2009;
Nussbaumer and Pinker, 2012; Choi et al., 2014). The arrows g indicate the interactions between the sea ice variations
and atmospheric dynamical processes. A series of studies demonstrated that recent loss of Arctic sea ice is triggered
by the atmospheric circulation changes such as a tendency toward a dipole pattern in the mean sea level pressure trend
with an increase over the Arctic Ocean and a decrease over Siberia. The Arctic dipole anomaly in summer
(Wang et al., 2009), winter (Watanabe et al., 2006) and spring (Kapsch et al., 2019) produces a strong meridional
wind (v-component) anomaly that drives more sea ice out of the Arctic Ocean. In addition, this dipole anomaly promotes
transport of heat and moisture and thus enhances downward longwave radiation and control the melt onset
(Huang et al., 2019b; Kapsch et al., 2019). Moreover, the changes in cyclone occurrence and/or depth during spring
(Screen et al., 2011) and summer (Simmonds and Rudeva, 2012) have preconditioning effects on the sea ice cover and
exert a strong influence on the amount of sea ice that survives the melt season. A recent study also pointed out that
a stronger anticyclonic circulation over Greenland and the Arctic Ocean in the troposphere may have contributed as much
as 60% to the September sea ice extent decline since 1979, by warming and moistening the lower atmosphere

These conclusions are mainly drawn from in-situ measurements during field campaign (Perovich et al., 2002; Sturm et al.,
2002), global reanalysis products and surface observations (Screen and Simmonds, 2012; Boisvert et al., 2018;
Wang et al., 2019). The higher precipitation and snowfall could result in a thicker snowpack that allows less heat
loss to the atmosphere. More importantly, modeling studies suggest that increases in Arctic precipitation over the
21st century, particularly in late autumn and winter, are due mainly to strongly intensified local surface evaporation
(latent heat flux) (Bintanja and Selten, 2014). Therefore, we believe that Arctic precipitation exerts direct influence
on sea ice variations (arrow i), while sea ice modulates precipitation mainly through sensible plus latent heat flux
(arrows h, b). Among these studies, very few of them have demonstrated the delayed impact of one variable on another.
Specifically, the net shortwave flux at the surface in early summer (Mayâ€“July) is found to enhance sea ice melt with a
lag of 1â€“4 months (Choi et al., 2014). Moreover, the sea ice condition exhibits the delayed impacts on itself, which is
called sea ice anomaly persistence (Guemas et al., 2016; Cruz-GarcÃ­a et al., 2019; Holland et al., 2019). The sea ice
anomaly persistence depends on the predictand (area, extent, volume), region, and the initial and target dates, which
can be varied from a few days to a few years (Guemas et al., 2016). With sea ice anomaly persistence,
there is predictability for the sea ice area in winter but low predictability throughout the rest of the year in
peripheral seas. Based on multiple model simulations, the Labrador Sea stands out among the considered regions,
with sea ice predictability extending up to 1.5 years (Cruz-GarcÃ­a et al., 2019). Note that most of studies mentioned
above determine the changes in one variable, happening before another one, by applying time series analysis and/or
composite analysis based on observations, reanalysis or model output (Perovich et al., 2002; Sturm et al., 2002; Kay
and Gettelman, 2009; Wang et al., 2009; Nussbaumer and Pinker, 2012; Kapsch et al., 2013; Choi et al., 2014; Boisvert

2018; Wang et al., 2019). Among them, some studies use more advanced statistical analysis such as empirical orthogonal
function (Watanabe et al., 2006; Overland and Wang, 2010) and self-organizing map (Kapsch et al., 2019; Rinke et al.,
2019). Other studies assess the causal links through targeted modeling experiments (Bintanja and Selten, 2014; Kapsch
et al., 2016; Ding et al., 2017; Huang et al., 2019a; Cruz-GarcÃ­a et al., 2019), in order to test whether a manipulation
of one variable has an impact on others. And most of the studies focus on relationships between only one or two

(Ding et al., 2017; Huang et al., 2021; Luo et al., 2021). On the other hand, the reduction in Arctic sea ice extent
and increase in open water area in late summer are found to directly contribute to a modification of large-scale

Huang et al. Arctic Sea Ice Causality Discovery circulation patterns in the following autumn through the additional
heat stored in the Arctic Ocean and released to the atmosphere during the autumn (Overland and Wang, 2010). The
increased 1,000â€“500 hPa thickness in autumn produce anomalous easterley zonal wind component (u-component), especially
over the north of Alaska and Canada. Moreover, a more meridional flow pattern associated with sea ice reduction have
an impact on the mid-latitude weather (Overland and Wang, 2010). These conclusions are mainly drawn from model
simulations (Watanabe et al., 2006; Rinke et al., 2019), reanalysis and observations (Wang et al., 2009; Overland and
Wang, 2010; Kapsch et al., 2019). In addition to radiation, the sensible plus latent heat flux also plays an important
role in the Arctic energy budget. The increase in the downward moisture flux triggers the melting of the sea ice in
spring (Boisvert et al., 2015; Boisvert and Stroeve, 2015; Marcovecchio et al., 2021). Earlier melt onset and loss of
sea ice in the spring enhance warming of the ice-free ocean surface, which in turn leads to an increase of evaporation
from the surface into the atmosphere in the autumn. This positive feedback between heat flux and sea ice, indicated
by arrow h, has been confirmed by satellite observations (Boisvert et al., 2015; Boisvert and Stroeve, 2015) and model
simulations (Huang et al., 2019a) during most months of the year. The arrow i represents the influence of precipitation
on Arctic sea ice variations. Specifically, the magnitude of precipitation accumulating over the sea ice pack largely
determines the depth of the snow layer, which modulates the rate of sea ice growth because of its highly insulating
properties (Sturm et al., 2002). The phase of the precipitation falling on the sea ice pack is also important. As rain,
it can melt, compact, and densify the snowpack, thus reducing the surface albedo and promoting sea ice melt (Perovich
et al., 2002).The recent snowfall decline in summer is essentially caused by changes in precipitation form (snow
turning to rain) with very little influence of decreases in total precipitation, which is a result of
lower-atmospheric warming. Then the loss of snow-on-ice results in a substantial decrease in the surface albedo over
the Arctic Ocean, causing additional surface ice melt by absorbing more solar radiation (Screen and Simmonds, 2012).

CAUSALITY BETWEEN ATMOSPHERIC PROCESSES AND ARCTIC SEA ICE VARIATIONS
Due to the two-way interactions between the atmosphere and sea ice, studying causality between them is a challenging but
important task, which makes it an area of high interest within polar climate community. The sea ice variations can be
caused by different dynamical and thermodynamical processes. Important dynamical processes include anomalous surface
wind (Spreen et al., 2011; Wu et al., 2012), regional atmospheric circulation patterns (Overland and Wang, 2010;
Screen et al., 2018; Rinke et al., 2019) and abnormal storm activities (Simmonds et al., 2008; Simmonds and Keay, 2009;
Screen et al., 2011; Simmonds and Rudeva, 2012; Parkinson and Comiso, 2013; Simmonds and Rudeva, 2014). Cloud (Kapsch
et al., 2013), radiation (Kay and Gettelman, 2009; Choi et al., 2014) and precipitation (Boisvert et al., 2018; Wang
et al., 2019; Marcovecchio et al., 2021) are the important thermodynamic factors controlling Arctic sea ice trends
and variability. On the other hand, sea ice decline in turn exerts large influence on the atmosphere, including
cloud (Kay and Gettelman, 2009; Morrison et al., 2018), surface energy budget (Semmler et al., 2012; Boisvert et al.,
2015; Boisvert and Stroeve, 2015), precipitation (Bintanja and Selten, 2014; Kopec et al., 2016) and large-scale

important after the melt has started (Kapsch et al., 2013; Huang et al., 2017). Once the surface albedo is
significantly reduced due to sea ice melt, the solar radiation could be absorbed by ocean, which further
accelerates ice melt in late spring and summer (Kay and Gettelman, 2009; Choi et al., 2014; Kapsch et al., 2016).
The feedback between surface net shortwave flux and sea ice, represented by arrow f in Figure 1, has been
confirmed by both model simulations (Kapsch et al., 2016) and satellite observations (Kay and Gettelman, 2009;
Nussbaumer and Pinker, 2012; Choi et al., 2014). The arrows g indicate the interactions between the sea ice variations
and atmospheric dynamical processes. A series of studies demonstrated that recent loss of Arctic sea ice is triggered
by the atmospheric circulation changes such as a tendency toward a dipole pattern in the mean sea level pressure trend
with an increase over the Arctic Ocean and a decrease over Siberia. The Arctic dipole anomaly in summer
(Wang et al., 2009), winter (Watanabe et al., 2006) and spring (Kapsch et al., 2019) produces a strong meridional
wind (v-component) anomaly that drives more sea ice out of the Arctic Ocean. In addition, this dipole anomaly promotes
transport of heat and moisture and thus enhances downward longwave radiation and control the melt onset
(Huang et al., 2019b; Kapsch et al., 2019). Moreover, the changes in cyclone occurrence and/or depth during spring
(Screen et al., 2011) and summer (Simmonds and Rudeva, 2012) have preconditioning effects on the sea ice cover and
exert a strong influence on the amount of sea ice that survives the melt season. A recent study also pointed out that
a stronger anticyclonic circulation over Greenland and the Arctic Ocean in the troposphere may have contributed as much
as 60% to the September sea ice extent decline since 1979, by warming and moistening the lower atmosphere

These conclusions are mainly drawn from in-situ measurements during field campaign (Perovich et al., 2002; Sturm et al.,
2002), global reanalysis products and surface observations (Screen and Simmonds, 2012; Boisvert et al., 2018;
Wang et al., 2019). The higher precipitation and snowfall could result in a thicker snowpack that allows less heat
loss to the atmosphere. More importantly, modeling studies suggest that increases in Arctic precipitation over the
21st century, particularly in late autumn and winter, are due mainly to strongly intensified local surface evaporation
(latent heat flux) (Bintanja and Selten, 2014). Therefore, we believe that Arctic precipitation exerts direct influence
on sea ice variations (arrow i), while sea ice modulates precipitation mainly through sensible plus latent heat flux
(arrows h, b). Among these studies, very few of them have demonstrated the delayed impact of one variable on another.
Specifically, the net shortwave flux at the surface in early summer (Mayâ€“July) is found to enhance sea ice melt with a
lag of 1â€“4 months (Choi et al., 2014). Moreover, the sea ice condition exhibits the delayed impacts on itself, which is
called sea ice anomaly persistence (Guemas et al., 2016; Cruz-GarcÃ­a et al., 2019; Holland et al., 2019). The sea ice
anomaly persistence depends on the predictand (area, extent, volume), region, and the initial and target dates, which
can be varied from a few days to a few years (Guemas et al., 2016). With sea ice anomaly persistence,
there is predictability for the sea ice area in winter but low predictability throughout the rest of the year in
peripheral seas. Based on multiple model simulations, the Labrador Sea stands out among the considered regions,
with sea ice predictability extending up to 1.5 years (Cruz-GarcÃ­a et al., 2019). Note that most of studies mentioned
above determine the changes in one variable, happening before another one, by applying time series analysis and/or
composite analysis based on observations, reanalysis or model output (Perovich et al., 2002; Sturm et al., 2002; Kay
and Gettelman, 2009; Wang et al., 2009; Nussbaumer and Pinker, 2012; Kapsch et al., 2013; Choi et al., 2014; Boisvert
et al., 2015; Boisvert and Stroeve, 2015; Cox et al., 2016; Huang et al., 2017; Huang et al., 2019b; Boisvert et al.,
2018; Wang et al., 2019). Among them, some studies use more advanced statistical analysis such as empirical orthogonal
function (Watanabe et al., 2006; Overland and Wang, 2010) and self-organizing map (Kapsch et al., 2019; Rinke et al.,
2019). Other studies assess the causal links through targeted modeling experiments (Bintanja and Selten, 2014; Kapsch
et al., 2016; Ding et al., 2017; Huang et al., 2019a; Cruz-GarcÃ­a et al., 2019), in order to test whether a manipulation
of one variable has an impact on others. And most of the studies focus on relationships between only one or two

(Ding et al., 2017; Huang et al., 2021; Luo et al., 2021). On the other hand, the reduction in Arctic sea ice extent
and increase in open water area in late summer are found to directly contribute to a modification of large-scale

Huang et al. Arctic Sea Ice Causality Discovery circulation patterns in the following autumn through the additional
heat stored in the Arctic Ocean and released to the atmosphere during the autumn (Overland and Wang, 2010). The
increased 1,000â€“500 hPa thickness in autumn produce anomalous easterley zonal wind component (u-component), especially
over the north of Alaska and Canada. Moreover, a more meridional flow pattern associated with sea ice reduction have
an impact on the mid-latitude weather (Overland and Wang, 2010). These conclusions are mainly drawn from model
simulations (Watanabe et al., 2006; Rinke et al., 2019), reanalysis and observations (Wang et al., 2009; Overland and
Wang, 2010; Kapsch et al., 2019). In addition to radiation, the sensible plus latent heat flux also plays an important
role in the Arctic energy budget. The increase in the downward moisture flux triggers the melting of the sea ice in
spring (Boisvert et al., 2015; Boisvert and Stroeve, 2015; Marcovecchio et al., 2021). Earlier melt onset and loss of
sea ice in the spring enhance warming of the ice-free ocean surface, which in turn leads to an increase of evaporation
from the surface into the atmosphere in the autumn. This positive feedback between heat flux and sea ice, indicated
by arrow h, has been confirmed by satellite observations (Boisvert et al., 2015; Boisvert and Stroeve, 2015) and model
simulations (Huang et al., 2019a) during most months of the year. The arrow i represents the influence of precipitation
on Arctic sea ice variations. Specifically, the magnitude of precipitation accumulating over the sea ice pack largely
determines the depth of the snow layer, which modulates the rate of sea ice growth because of its highly insulating
properties (Sturm et al., 2002). The phase of the precipitation falling on the sea ice pack is also important. As rain,
it can melt, compact, and densify the snowpack, thus reducing the surface albedo and promoting sea ice melt (Perovich
et al., 2002).The recent snowfall decline in summer is essentially caused by changes in precipitation form (snow
turning to rain) with very little influence of decreases in total precipitation, which is a result of
lower-atmospheric warming. Then the loss of snow-on-ice results in a substantial decrease in the surface albedo over
the Arctic Ocean, causing additional surface ice melt by absorbing more solar radiation (Screen and Simmonds, 2012).

CAUSALITY BETWEEN ATMOSPHERIC PROCESSES AND ARCTIC SEA ICE VARIATIONS
Due to the two-way interactions between the atmosphere and sea ice, studying causality between them is a challenging but
important task, which makes it an area of high interest within polar climate community. The sea ice variations can be
caused by different dynamical and thermodynamical processes. Important dynamical processes include anomalous surface
wind (Spreen et al., 2011; Wu et al., 2012), regional atmospheric circulation patterns (Overland and Wang, 2010;
Screen et al., 2018; Rinke et al., 2019) and abnormal storm activities (Simmonds et al., 2008; Simmonds and Keay, 2009;
Screen et al., 2011; Simmonds and Rudeva, 2012; Parkinson and Comiso, 2013; Simmonds and Rudeva, 2014). Cloud (Kapsch
et al., 2013), radiation (Kay and Gettelman, 2009; Choi et al., 2014) and precipitation (Boisvert et al., 2018; Wang
et al., 2019; Marcovecchio et al., 2021) are the important thermodynamic factors controlling Arctic sea ice trends
and variability. On the other hand, sea ice decline in turn exerts large influence on the atmosphere, including
cloud (Kay and Gettelman, 2009; Morrison et al., 2018), surface energy budget (Semmler et al., 2012; Boisvert et al.,
2015; Boisvert and Stroeve, 2015), precipitation (Bintanja and Selten, 2014; Kopec et al., 2016) and large-scale
circulation (Chemke et al., 2019; Kennel and Yulaeva, 2020). Figure 1 depicts the causal relations between key
atmospheric variables and sea ice over the Arctic. The sea ice here represents sea ice coverage and/or sea ice
thickness. Note that the processes a âˆ’ d are well-known atmospheric processes, including cloud microphysics,
thermodynamics, radiation, climate dynamics, which have been studied over the past few decades. The processes
e âˆ’ i are summarized from more recent publications, which are still under investigation by climate scientists.
We will explain processes e âˆ’ i in details in the next paragraph. The arrow e represents the two-way effect between
sea ice and net longwave flux at the surface. Based on global reanalysis (Kapsch et al., 2013; Lee et al., 2017),
surface (Cox et al., 2016) and satellite observations (Huang et al., 2017), as well as model simulations (Kapsch et
al., 2016; Huang et al., 2019a), the downward longwave radiation at the surface dominates surface warming and
therefore enhances sea ice melt in winter and spring. The increase in downward longwave flux is a result of an
increase in cloudiness and moisture in the Arctic Basin, which is caused by enhanced local evaporation or moisture
transport from mid-latitudes (Luo et al., 2017). Positive anomalies of longwave flux in spring and early summer
initiate an earlier melt onset, thereby triggering several feedback mechanisms which amplify melt during the
succeeding months (Kapsch et al., 2016; Huang et al., 2019b). The sea ice melt increases the air temperature

atmospheric processes with changes in Arctic sea ice. Therefore, in this study, we target to provide a more
comprehensive analysis about causality between multiple atmospheric processes and sea ice by applying different
data-driven causality approaches.

by the atmospheric circulation changes such as a tendency toward a dipole pattern in the mean sea level pressure trend
with an increase over the Arctic Ocean and a decrease over Siberia. The Arctic dipole anomaly in summer
(Wang et al., 2009), winter (Watanabe et al., 2006) and spring (Kapsch et al., 2019) produces a strong meridional
wind (v-component) anomaly that drives more sea ice out of the Arctic Ocean. In addition, this dipole anomaly promotes
transport of heat and moisture and thus enhances downward longwave radiation and control the melt onset
(Huang et al., 2019b; Kapsch et al., 2019). Moreover, the changes in cyclone occurrence and/or depth during spring
(Screen et al., 2011) and summer (Simmonds and Rudeva, 2012) have preconditioning effects on the sea ice cover and
exert a strong influence on the amount of sea ice that survives the melt season. A recent study also pointed out that
a stronger anticyclonic circulation over Greenland and the Arctic Ocean in the troposphere may have contributed as much

These conclusions are mainly drawn from in-situ measurements during field campaign (Perovich et al., 2002; Sturm et al.,

Wang et al., 2019). The higher precipitation and snowfall could result in a thicker snowpack that allows less heat
loss to the atmosphere. More importantly, modeling studies suggest that increases in Arctic precipitation over the
21st century, particularly in late autumn and winter, are due mainly to strongly intensified local surface evaporation
(latent heat flux) (Bintanja and Selten, 2014). Therefore, we believe that Arctic precipitation exerts direct influence
on sea ice variations (arrow i), while sea ice modulates precipitation mainly through sensible plus latent heat flux
(arrows h, b). Among these studies, very few of them have demonstrated the delayed impact of one variable on another.
Specifically, the net shortwave flux at the surface in early summer (Mayâ€“July) is found to enhance sea ice melt with a

called sea ice anomaly persistence (Guemas et al., 2016; Cruz-GarcÃ­a et al., 2019; Holland et al., 2019). The sea ice
anomaly persistence depends on the predictand (area, extent, volume), region, and the initial and target dates, which
can be varied from a few days to a few years (Guemas et al., 2016). With sea ice anomaly persistence,
there is predictability for the sea ice area in winter but low predictability throughout the rest of the year in
peripheral seas. Based on multiple model simulations, the Labrador Sea stands out among the considered regions,

function (Watanabe et al., 2006; Overland and Wang, 2010) and self-organizing map (Kapsch et al., 2019; Rinke et al.,

(Ding et al., 2017; Huang et al., 2021; Luo et al., 2021). On the other hand, the reduction in Arctic sea ice extent

Huang et al. Arctic Sea Ice Causality Discovery circulation patterns in the following autumn through the additional
heat stored in the Arctic Ocean and released to the atmosphere during the autumn (Overland and Wang, 2010). The
increased 1,000â€“500 hPa thickness in autumn produce anomalous easterley zonal wind component (u-component), especially
over the north of Alaska and Canada. Moreover, a more meridional flow pattern associated with sea ice reduction have
an impact on the mid-latitude weather (Overland and Wang, 2010). These conclusions are mainly drawn from model
simulations (Watanabe et al., 2006; Rinke et al., 2019), reanalysis and observations (Wang et al., 2009; Overland and
Wang, 2010; Kapsch et al., 2019). In addition to radiation, the sensible plus latent heat flux also plays an important
role in the Arctic energy budget. The increase in the downward moisture flux triggers the melting of the sea ice in
spring (Boisvert et al., 2015; Boisvert and Stroeve, 2015; Marcovecchio et al., 2021). Earlier melt onset and loss of
sea ice in the spring enhance warming of the ice-free ocean surface, which in turn leads to an increase of evaporation
from the surface into the atmosphere in the autumn. This positive feedback between heat flux and sea ice, indicated
by arrow h, has been confirmed by satellite observations (Boisvert et al., 2015; Boisvert and Stroeve, 2015) and model
simulations (Huang et al., 2019a) during most months of the year. The arrow i represents the influence of precipitation
on Arctic sea ice variations. Specifically, the magnitude of precipitation accumulating over the sea ice pack largely
determines the depth of the snow layer, which modulates the rate of sea ice growth because of its highly insulating
properties (Sturm et al., 2002). The phase of the precipitation falling on the sea ice pack is also important. As rain,
it can melt, compact, and densify the snowpack, thus reducing the surface albedo and promoting sea ice melt (Perovich
et al., 2002).The recent snowfall decline in summer is essentially caused by changes in precipitation form (snow
turning to rain) with very little influence of decreases in total precipitation, which is a result of
lower-atmospheric warming. Then the loss of snow-on-ice results in a substantial decrease in the surface albedo over
the Arctic Ocean, causing additional surface ice melt by absorbing more solar radiation (Screen and Simmonds, 2012).

CAUSALITY BETWEEN ATMOSPHERIC PROCESSES AND ARCTIC SEA ICE VARIATIONS
Due to the two-way interactions between the atmosphere and sea ice, studying causality between them is a challenging but
important task, which makes it an area of high interest within polar climate community. The sea ice variations can be
caused by different dynamical and thermodynamical processes. Important dynamical processes include anomalous surface
wind (Spreen et al., 2011; Wu et al., 2012), regional atmospheric circulation patterns (Overland and Wang, 2010;
Screen et al., 2018; Rinke et al., 2019) and abnormal storm activities (Simmonds et al., 2008; Simmonds and Keay, 2009;
Screen et al., 2011; Simmonds and Rudeva, 2012; Parkinson and Comiso, 2013; Simmonds and Rudeva, 2014). Cloud (Kapsch
et al., 2013), radiation (Kay and Gettelman, 2009; Choi et al., 2014) and precipitation (Boisvert et al., 2018; Wang
et al., 2019; Marcovecchio et al., 2021) are the important thermodynamic factors controlling Arctic sea ice trends
and variability. On the other hand, sea ice decline in turn exerts large influence on the atmosphere, including
cloud (Kay and Gettelman, 2009; Morrison et al., 2018), surface energy budget (Semmler et al., 2012; Boisvert et al.,
2015; Boisvert and Stroeve, 2015), precipitation (Bintanja and Selten, 2014; Kopec et al., 2016) and large-scale
circulation (Chemke et al., 2019; Kennel and Yulaeva, 2020). Figure 1 depicts the causal relations between key
atmospheric variables and sea ice over the Arctic. The sea ice here represents sea ice coverage and/or sea ice
thickness. Note that the processes a âˆ’ d are well-known atmospheric processes, including cloud microphysics,
thermodynamics, radiation, climate dynamics, which have been studied over the past few decades. The processes
e âˆ’ i are summarized from more recent publications, which are still under investigation by climate scientists.
We will explain processes e âˆ’ i in details in the next paragraph. The arrow e represents the two-way effect between
sea ice and net longwave flux at the surface. Based on global reanalysis (Kapsch et al., 2013; Lee et al., 2017),
surface (Cox et al., 2016) and satellite observations (Huang et al., 2017), as well as model simulations (Kapsch et
al., 2016; Huang et al., 2019a), the downward longwave radiation at the surface dominates surface warming and
therefore enhances sea ice melt in winter and spring. The increase in downward longwave flux is a result of an
increase in cloudiness and moisture in the Arctic Basin, which is caused by enhanced local evaporation or moisture
transport from mid-latitudes (Luo et al., 2017). Positive anomalies of longwave flux in spring and early summer
initiate an earlier melt onset, thereby triggering several feedback mechanisms which amplify melt during the
succeeding months (Kapsch et al., 2016; Huang et al., 2019b). The sea ice melt increases the air temperature

atmospheric processes with changes in Arctic sea ice. Therefore, in this study, we target to provide a more
comprehensive analysis about causality between multiple atmospheric processes and sea ice by applying different
data-driven causality approaches.

Huang et al. Arctic Sea Ice Causality Discovery surface. The downward shortwave flux, however, appears only
important after the melt has started (Kapsch et al., 2013; Huang et al., 2017). Once the surface albedo is
significantly reduced due to sea ice melt, the solar radiation could be absorbed by ocean, which further
accelerates ice melt in late spring and summer (Kay and Gettelman, 2009; Choi et al., 2014; Kapsch et al., 2016).
The feedback between surface net shortwave flux and sea ice, represented by arrow f in Figure 1, has been
confirmed by both model simulations (Kapsch et al., 2016) and satellite observations (Kay and Gettelman, 2009;
Nussbaumer and Pinker, 2012; Choi et al., 2014). The arrows g indicate the interactions between the sea ice variations
and atmospheric dynamical processes. A series of studies demonstrated that recent loss of Arctic sea ice is triggered
by the atmospheric circulation changes such as a tendency toward a dipole pattern in the mean sea level pressure trend
with an increase over the Arctic Ocean and a decrease over Siberia. The Arctic dipole anomaly in summer
(Wang et al., 2009), winter (Watanabe et al., 2006) and spring (Kapsch et al., 2019) produces a strong meridional
wind (v-component) anomaly that drives more sea ice out of the Arctic Ocean. In addition, this dipole anomaly promotes
transport of heat and moisture and thus enhances downward longwave radiation and control the melt onset
(Huang et al., 2019b; Kapsch et al., 2019). Moreover, the changes in cyclone occurrence and/or depth during spring
(Screen et al., 2011) and summer (Simmonds and Rudeva, 2012) have preconditioning effects on the sea ice cover and
exert a strong influence on the amount of sea ice that survives the melt season. A recent study also pointed out that
a stronger anticyclonic circulation over Greenland and the Arctic Ocean in the troposphere may have contributed as much
as 60% to the September sea ice extent decline since 1979, by warming and moistening the lower atmosphere

These conclusions are mainly drawn from in-situ measurements during field campaign (Perovich et al., 2002; Sturm et al.,
2002), global reanalysis products and surface observations (Screen and Simmonds, 2012; Boisvert et al., 2018;
Wang et al., 2019). The higher precipitation and snowfall could result in a thicker snowpack that allows less heat
loss to the atmosphere. More importantly, modeling studies suggest that increases in Arctic precipitation over the
21st century, particularly in late autumn and winter, are due mainly to strongly intensified local surface evaporation
(latent heat flux) (Bintanja and Selten, 2014). Therefore, we believe that Arctic precipitation exerts direct influence
on sea ice variations (arrow i), while sea ice modulates precipitation mainly through sensible plus latent heat flux
(arrows h, b). Among these studies, very few of them have demonstrated the delayed impact of one variable on another.
Specifically, the net shortwave flux at the surface in early summer (Mayâ€“July) is found to enhance sea ice melt with a
lag of 1â€“4 months (Choi et al., 2014). Moreover, the sea ice condition exhibits the delayed impacts on itself, which is
called sea ice anomaly persistence (Guemas et al., 2016; Cruz-GarcÃ­a et al., 2019; Holland et al., 2019). The sea ice
anomaly persistence depends on the predictand (area, extent, volume), region, and the initial and target dates, which
can be varied from a few days to a few years (Guemas et al., 2016). With sea ice anomaly persistence,
there is predictability for the sea ice area in winter but low predictability throughout the rest of the year in
peripheral seas. Based on multiple model simulations, the Labrador Sea stands out among the considered regions,
with sea ice predictability extending up to 1.5 years (Cruz-GarcÃ­a et al., 2019). Note that most of studies mentioned
above determine the changes in one variable, happening before another one, by applying time series analysis and/or
composite analysis based on observations, reanalysis or model output (Perovich et al., 2002; Sturm et al., 2002; Kay

simulations (Huang et al., 2019a) during most months of the year. The arrow i represents the influence of precipitation
on Arctic sea ice variations. Specifically, the magnitude of precipitation accumulating over the sea ice pack largely
determines the depth of the snow layer, which modulates the rate of sea ice growth because of its highly insulating
properties (Sturm et al., 2002). The phase of the precipitation falling on the sea ice pack is also important. As rain,
it can melt, compact, and densify the snowpack, thus reducing the surface albedo and promoting sea ice melt (Perovich
et al., 2002).The recent snowfall decline in summer is essentially caused by changes in precipitation form (snow
turning to rain) with very little influence of decreases in total precipitation, which is a result of
lower-atmospheric warming. Then the loss of snow-on-ice results in a substantial decrease in the surface albedo over
the Arctic Ocean, causing additional surface ice melt by absorbing more solar radiation (Screen and Simmonds, 2012).

CAUSALITY BETWEEN ATMOSPHERIC PROCESSES AND ARCTIC SEA ICE VARIATIONS
Due to the two-way interactions between the atmosphere and sea ice, studying causality between them is a challenging but
important task, which makes it an area of high interest within polar climate community. The sea ice variations can be
caused by different dynamical and thermodynamical processes. Important dynamical processes include anomalous surface
wind (Spreen et al., 2011; Wu et al., 2012), regional atmospheric circulation patterns (Overland and Wang, 2010;
Screen et al., 2018; Rinke et al., 2019) and abnormal storm activities (Simmonds et al., 2008; Simmonds and Keay, 2009;
Screen et al., 2011; Simmonds and Rudeva, 2012; Parkinson and Comiso, 2013; Simmonds and Rudeva, 2014). Cloud (Kapsch
et al., 2013), radiation (Kay and Gettelman, 2009; Choi et al., 2014) and precipitation (Boisvert et al., 2018; Wang
et al., 2019; Marcovecchio et al., 2021) are the important thermodynamic factors controlling Arctic sea ice trends
and variability. On the other hand, sea ice decline in turn exerts large influence on the atmosphere, including
cloud (Kay and Gettelman, 2009; Morrison et al., 2018), surface energy budget (Semmler et al., 2012; Boisvert et al.,
2015; Boisvert and Stroeve, 2015), precipitation (Bintanja and Selten, 2014; Kopec et al., 2016) and large-scale
circulation (Chemke et al., 2019; Kennel and Yulaeva, 2020). Figure 1 depicts the causal relations between key
atmospheric variables and sea ice over the Arctic. The sea ice here represents sea ice coverage and/or sea ice
thickness. Note that the processes a âˆ’ d are well-known atmospheric processes, including cloud microphysics,
thermodynamics, radiation, climate dynamics, which have been studied over the past few decades. The processes
e âˆ’ i are summarized from more recent publications, which are still under investigation by climate scientists.
We will explain processes e âˆ’ i in details in the next paragraph. The arrow e represents the two-way effect between
sea ice and net longwave flux at the surface. Based on global reanalysis (Kapsch et al., 2013; Lee et al., 2017),
surface (Cox et al., 2016) and satellite observations (Huang et al., 2017), as well as model simulations (Kapsch et
al., 2016; Huang et al., 2019a), the downward longwave radiation at the surface dominates surface warming and
therefore enhances sea ice melt in winter and spring. The increase in downward longwave flux is a result of an
increase in cloudiness and moisture in the Arctic Basin, which is caused by enhanced local evaporation or moisture
transport from mid-latitudes (Luo et al., 2017). Positive anomalies of longwave flux in spring and early summer
initiate an earlier melt onset, thereby triggering several feedback mechanisms which amplify melt during the
succeeding months (Kapsch et al., 2016; Huang et al., 2019b). The sea ice melt increases the air temperature

atmospheric processes with changes in Arctic sea ice. Therefore, in this study, we target to provide a more
comprehensive analysis about causality between multiple atmospheric processes and sea ice by applying different
data-driven causality approaches.

According to the information provided, sea level pressure (SLP) is not explicitly mentioned as a direct cause of sea ice coverage and/or sea ice thickness. The context mentions several atmospheric processes and variables that are known to influence sea ice, such as surface wind, atmospheric circulation patterns, storm activities, cloud, radiation, and precipitation. These processes interact with sea ice and can affect its variations.

While SLP is an important atmospheric variable, its direct causal relationship with sea ice coverage and/or sea ice thickness is not explicitly stated in the context.

Huang et al. Arctic Sea Ice Causality Discovery surface. The downward shortwave flux, however, appears only
important after the melt has started (Kapsch et al., 2013; Huang et al., 2017). Once the surface albedo is
significantly reduced due to sea ice melt, the solar radiation could be absorbed by ocean, which further
accelerates ice melt in late spring and summer (Kay and Gettelman, 2009; Choi et al., 2014; Kapsch et al., 2016).
The feedback between surface net shortwave flux and sea ice, represented by arrow f in Figure 1, has been
confirmed by both model simulations (Kapsch et al., 2016) and satellite observations (Kay and Gettelman, 2009;
Nussbaumer and Pinker, 2012; Choi et al., 2014). The arrows g indicate the interactions between the sea ice variations
and atmospheric dynamical processes. A series of studies demonstrated that recent loss of Arctic sea ice is triggered
by the atmospheric circulation changes such as a tendency toward a dipole pattern in the mean sea level pressure trend
with an increase over the Arctic Ocean and a decrease over Siberia. The Arctic dipole anomaly in summer
(Wang et al., 2009), winter (Watanabe et al., 2006) and spring (Kapsch et al., 2019) produces a strong meridional
wind (v-component) anomaly that drives more sea ice out of the Arctic Ocean. In addition, this dipole anomaly promotes
transport of heat and moisture and thus enhances downward longwave radiation and control the melt onset
(Huang et al., 2019b; Kapsch et al., 2019). Moreover, the changes in cyclone occurrence and/or depth during spring
(Screen et al., 2011) and summer (Simmonds and Rudeva, 2012) have preconditioning effects on the sea ice cover and
exert a strong influence on the amount of sea ice that survives the melt season. A recent study also pointed out that
a stronger anticyclonic circulation over Greenland and the Arctic Ocean in the troposphere may have contributed as much
as 60% to the September sea ice extent decline since 1979, by warming and moistening the lower atmosphere

These conclusions are mainly drawn from in-situ measurements during field campaign (Perovich et al., 2002; Sturm et al.,
2002), global reanalysis products and surface observations (Screen and Simmonds, 2012; Boisvert et al., 2018;
Wang et al., 2019). The higher precipitation and snowfall could result in a thicker snowpack that allows less heat
loss to the atmosphere. More importantly, modeling studies suggest that increases in Arctic precipitation over the
21st century, particularly in late autumn and winter, are due mainly to strongly intensified local surface evaporation
(latent heat flux) (Bintanja and Selten, 2014). Therefore, we believe that Arctic precipitation exerts direct influence
on sea ice variations (arrow i), while sea ice modulates precipitation mainly through sensible plus latent heat flux
(arrows h, b). Among these studies, very few of them have demonstrated the delayed impact of one variable on another.
Specifically, the net shortwave flux at the surface in early summer (Mayâ€“July) is found to enhance sea ice melt with a
lag of 1â€“4 months (Choi et al., 2014). Moreover, the sea ice condition exhibits the delayed impacts on itself, which is
called sea ice anomaly persistence (Guemas et al., 2016; Cruz-GarcÃ­a et al., 2019; Holland et al., 2019). The sea ice
anomaly persistence depends on the predictand (area, extent, volume), region, and the initial and target dates, which
can be varied from a few days to a few years (Guemas et al., 2016). With sea ice anomaly persistence,
there is predictability for the sea ice area in winter but low predictability throughout the rest of the year in
peripheral seas. Based on multiple model simulations, the Labrador Sea stands out among the considered regions,
with sea ice predictability extending up to 1.5 years (Cruz-GarcÃ­a et al., 2019). Note that most of studies mentioned
above determine the changes in one variable, happening before another one, by applying time series analysis and/or
composite analysis based on observations, reanalysis or model output (Perovich et al., 2002; Sturm et al., 2002; Kay
and Gettelman, 2009; Wang et al., 2009; Nussbaumer and Pinker, 2012; Kapsch et al., 2013; Choi et al., 2014; Boisvert

2018; Wang et al., 2019). Among them, some studies use more advanced statistical analysis such as empirical orthogonal
function (Watanabe et al., 2006; Overland and Wang, 2010) and self-organizing map (Kapsch et al., 2019; Rinke et al.,
2019). Other studies assess the causal links through targeted modeling experiments (Bintanja and Selten, 2014; Kapsch
et al., 2016; Ding et al., 2017; Huang et al., 2019a; Cruz-GarcÃ­a et al., 2019), in order to test whether a manipulation
of one variable has an impact on others. And most of the studies focus on relationships between only one or two

(Ding et al., 2017; Huang et al., 2021; Luo et al., 2021). On the other hand, the reduction in Arctic sea ice extent
and increase in open water area in late summer are found to directly contribute to a modification of large-scale

Huang et al. Arctic Sea Ice Causality Discovery circulation patterns in the following autumn through the additional
heat stored in the Arctic Ocean and released to the atmosphere during the autumn (Overland and Wang, 2010). The
increased 1,000â€“500 hPa thickness in autumn produce anomalous easterley zonal wind component (u-component), especially
over the north of Alaska and Canada. Moreover, a more meridional flow pattern associated with sea ice reduction have
an impact on the mid-latitude weather (Overland and Wang, 2010). These conclusions are mainly drawn from model
simulations (Watanabe et al., 2006; Rinke et al., 2019), reanalysis and observations (Wang et al., 2009; Overland and
Wang, 2010; Kapsch et al., 2019). In addition to radiation, the sensible plus latent heat flux also plays an important
role in the Arctic energy budget. The increase in the downward moisture flux triggers the melting of the sea ice in
spring (Boisvert et al., 2015; Boisvert and Stroeve, 2015; Marcovecchio et al., 2021). Earlier melt onset and loss of
sea ice in the spring enhance warming of the ice-free ocean surface, which in turn leads to an increase of evaporation
from the surface into the atmosphere in the autumn. This positive feedback between heat flux and sea ice, indicated
by arrow h, has been confirmed by satellite observations (Boisvert et al., 2015; Boisvert and Stroeve, 2015) and model

al., 2016; Huang et al., 2019a), the downward longwave radiation at the surface dominates surface warming and
therefore enhances sea ice melt in winter and spring. The increase in downward longwave flux is a result of an
increase in cloudiness and moisture in the Arctic Basin, which is caused by enhanced local evaporation or moisture
transport from mid-latitudes (Luo et al., 2017). Positive anomalies of longwave flux in spring and early summer
initiate an earlier melt onset, thereby triggering several feedback mechanisms which amplify melt during the
succeeding months (Kapsch et al., 2016; Huang et al., 2019b). The sea ice melt increases the air temperature

atmospheric processes with changes in Arctic sea ice. Therefore, in this study, we target to provide a more
comprehensive analysis about causality between multiple atmospheric processes and sea ice by applying different
data-driven causality approaches.

Huang et al. Arctic Sea Ice Causality Discovery surface. The downward shortwave flux, however, appears only
important after the melt has started (Kapsch et al., 2013; Huang et al., 2017). Once the surface albedo is
significantly reduced due to sea ice melt, the solar radiation could be absorbed by ocean, which further
accelerates ice melt in late spring and summer (Kay and Gettelman, 2009; Choi et al., 2014; Kapsch et al., 2016).
The feedback between surface net shortwave flux and sea ice, represented by arrow f in Figure 1, has been
confirmed by both model simulations (Kapsch et al., 2016) and satellite observations (Kay and Gettelman, 2009;
Nussbaumer and Pinker, 2012; Choi et al., 2014). The arrows g indicate the interactions between the sea ice variations
and atmospheric dynamical processes. A series of studies demonstrated that recent loss of Arctic sea ice is triggered
by the atmospheric circulation changes such as a tendency toward a dipole pattern in the mean sea level pressure trend
with an increase over the Arctic Ocean and a decrease over Siberia. The Arctic dipole anomaly in summer
(Wang et al., 2009), winter (Watanabe et al., 2006) and spring (Kapsch et al., 2019) produces a strong meridional
wind (v-component) anomaly that drives more sea ice out of the Arctic Ocean. In addition, this dipole anomaly promotes
transport of heat and moisture and thus enhances downward longwave radiation and control the melt onset
(Huang et al., 2019b; Kapsch et al., 2019). Moreover, the changes in cyclone occurrence and/or depth during spring
(Screen et al., 2011) and summer (Simmonds and Rudeva, 2012) have preconditioning effects on the sea ice cover and
exert a strong influence on the amount of sea ice that survives the melt season. A recent study also pointed out that
a stronger anticyclonic circulation over Greenland and the Arctic Ocean in the troposphere may have contributed as much
as 60% to the September sea ice extent decline since 1979, by warming and moistening the lower atmosphere

These conclusions are mainly drawn from in-situ measurements during field campaign (Perovich et al., 2002; Sturm et al.,
2002), global reanalysis products and surface observations (Screen and Simmonds, 2012; Boisvert et al., 2018;
Wang et al., 2019). The higher precipitation and snowfall could result in a thicker snowpack that allows less heat
loss to the atmosphere. More importantly, modeling studies suggest that increases in Arctic precipitation over the
21st century, particularly in late autumn and winter, are due mainly to strongly intensified local surface evaporation
(latent heat flux) (Bintanja and Selten, 2014). Therefore, we believe that Arctic precipitation exerts direct influence
on sea ice variations (arrow i), while sea ice modulates precipitation mainly through sensible plus latent heat flux
(arrows h, b). Among these studies, very few of them have demonstrated the delayed impact of one variable on another.
Specifically, the net shortwave flux at the surface in early summer (Mayâ€“July) is found to enhance sea ice melt with a
lag of 1â€“4 months (Choi et al., 2014). Moreover, the sea ice condition exhibits the delayed impacts on itself, which is
called sea ice anomaly persistence (Guemas et al., 2016; Cruz-GarcÃ­a et al., 2019; Holland et al., 2019). The sea ice
anomaly persistence depends on the predictand (area, extent, volume), region, and the initial and target dates, which
can be varied from a few days to a few years (Guemas et al., 2016). With sea ice anomaly persistence,
there is predictability for the sea ice area in winter but low predictability throughout the rest of the year in
peripheral seas. Based on multiple model simulations, the Labrador Sea stands out among the considered regions,
with sea ice predictability extending up to 1.5 years (Cruz-GarcÃ­a et al., 2019). Note that most of studies mentioned
above determine the changes in one variable, happening before another one, by applying time series analysis and/or
composite analysis based on observations, reanalysis or model output (Perovich et al., 2002; Sturm et al., 2002; Kay
and Gettelman, 2009; Wang et al., 2009; Nussbaumer and Pinker, 2012; Kapsch et al., 2013; Choi et al., 2014; Boisvert
et al., 2015; Boisvert and Stroeve, 2015; Cox et al., 2016; Huang et al., 2017; Huang et al., 2019b; Boisvert et al.,
2018; Wang et al., 2019). Among them, some studies use more advanced statistical analysis such as empirical orthogonal
function (Watanabe et al., 2006; Overland and Wang, 2010) and self-organizing map (Kapsch et al., 2019; Rinke et al.,
2019). Other studies assess the causal links through targeted modeling experiments (Bintanja and Selten, 2014; Kapsch
et al., 2016; Ding et al., 2017; Huang et al., 2019a; Cruz-GarcÃ­a et al., 2019), in order to test whether a manipulation
of one variable has an impact on others. And most of the studies focus on relationships between only one or two

(Ding et al., 2017; Huang et al., 2021; Luo et al., 2021). On the other hand, the reduction in Arctic sea ice extent
and increase in open water area in late summer are found to directly contribute to a modification of large-scale

Huang et al. Arctic Sea Ice Causality Discovery circulation patterns in the following autumn through the additional
heat stored in the Arctic Ocean and released to the atmosphere during the autumn (Overland and Wang, 2010). The
increased 1,000â€“500 hPa thickness in autumn produce anomalous easterley zonal wind component (u-component), especially
over the north of Alaska and Canada. Moreover, a more meridional flow pattern associated with sea ice reduction have
an impact on the mid-latitude weather (Overland and Wang, 2010). These conclusions are mainly drawn from model
simulations (Watanabe et al., 2006; Rinke et al., 2019), reanalysis and observations (Wang et al., 2009; Overland and
Wang, 2010; Kapsch et al., 2019). In addition to radiation, the sensible plus latent heat flux also plays an important
role in the Arctic energy budget. The increase in the downward moisture flux triggers the melting of the sea ice in
spring (Boisvert et al., 2015; Boisvert and Stroeve, 2015; Marcovecchio et al., 2021). Earlier melt onset and loss of
sea ice in the spring enhance warming of the ice-free ocean surface, which in turn leads to an increase of evaporation
from the surface into the atmosphere in the autumn. This positive feedback between heat flux and sea ice, indicated
by arrow h, has been confirmed by satellite observations (Boisvert et al., 2015; Boisvert and Stroeve, 2015) and model
simulations (Huang et al., 2019a) during most months of the year. The arrow i represents the influence of precipitation
on Arctic sea ice variations. Specifically, the magnitude of precipitation accumulating over the sea ice pack largely
determines the depth of the snow layer, which modulates the rate of sea ice growth because of its highly insulating
properties (Sturm et al., 2002). The phase of the precipitation falling on the sea ice pack is also important. As rain,
it can melt, compact, and densify the snowpack, thus reducing the surface albedo and promoting sea ice melt (Perovich
et al., 2002).The recent snowfall decline in summer is essentially caused by changes in precipitation form (snow
turning to rain) with very little influence of decreases in total precipitation, which is a result of
lower-atmospheric warming. Then the loss of snow-on-ice results in a substantial decrease in the surface albedo over
the Arctic Ocean, causing additional surface ice melt by absorbing more solar radiation (Screen and Simmonds, 2012).

CAUSALITY BETWEEN ATMOSPHERIC PROCESSES AND ARCTIC SEA ICE VARIATIONS
Due to the two-way interactions between the atmosphere and sea ice, studying causality between them is a challenging but
important task, which makes it an area of high interest within polar climate community. The sea ice variations can be
caused by different dynamical and thermodynamical processes. Important dynamical processes include anomalous surface
wind (Spreen et al., 2011; Wu et al., 2012), regional atmospheric circulation patterns (Overland and Wang, 2010;
Screen et al., 2018; Rinke et al., 2019) and abnormal storm activities (Simmonds et al., 2008; Simmonds and Keay, 2009;
Screen et al., 2011; Simmonds and Rudeva, 2012; Parkinson and Comiso, 2013; Simmonds and Rudeva, 2014). Cloud (Kapsch
et al., 2013), radiation (Kay and Gettelman, 2009; Choi et al., 2014) and precipitation (Boisvert et al., 2018; Wang
et al., 2019; Marcovecchio et al., 2021) are the important thermodynamic factors controlling Arctic sea ice trends
and variability. On the other hand, sea ice decline in turn exerts large influence on the atmosphere, including
cloud (Kay and Gettelman, 2009; Morrison et al., 2018), surface energy budget (Semmler et al., 2012; Boisvert et al.,
2015; Boisvert and Stroeve, 2015), precipitation (Bintanja and Selten, 2014; Kopec et al., 2016) and large-scale
circulation (Chemke et al., 2019; Kennel and Yulaeva, 2020). Figure 1 depicts the causal relations between key
atmospheric variables and sea ice over the Arctic. The sea ice here represents sea ice coverage and/or sea ice
thickness. Note that the processes a âˆ’ d are well-known atmospheric processes, including cloud microphysics,
thermodynamics, radiation, climate dynamics, which have been studied over the past few decades. The processes
e âˆ’ i are summarized from more recent publications, which are still under investigation by climate scientists.
We will explain processes e âˆ’ i in details in the next paragraph. The arrow e represents the two-way effect between
sea ice and net longwave flux at the surface. Based on global reanalysis (Kapsch et al., 2013; Lee et al., 2017),
surface (Cox et al., 2016) and satellite observations (Huang et al., 2017), as well as model simulations (Kapsch et

The feedback between surface net shortwave flux and sea ice, represented by arrow f in Figure 1, has been
confirmed by both model simulations (Kapsch et al., 2016) and satellite observations (Kay and Gettelman, 2009;
Nussbaumer and Pinker, 2012; Choi et al., 2014). The arrows g indicate the interactions between the sea ice variations
and atmospheric dynamical processes. A series of studies demonstrated that recent loss of Arctic sea ice is triggered
by the atmospheric circulation changes such as a tendency toward a dipole pattern in the mean sea level pressure trend
with an increase over the Arctic Ocean and a decrease over Siberia. The Arctic dipole anomaly in summer
(Wang et al., 2009), winter (Watanabe et al., 2006) and spring (Kapsch et al., 2019) produces a strong meridional
wind (v-component) anomaly that drives more sea ice out of the Arctic Ocean. In addition, this dipole anomaly promotes
transport of heat and moisture and thus enhances downward longwave radiation and control the melt onset
(Huang et al., 2019b; Kapsch et al., 2019). Moreover, the changes in cyclone occurrence and/or depth during spring
(Screen et al., 2011) and summer (Simmonds and Rudeva, 2012) have preconditioning effects on the sea ice cover and
exert a strong influence on the amount of sea ice that survives the melt season. A recent study also pointed out that
a stronger anticyclonic circulation over Greenland and the Arctic Ocean in the troposphere may have contributed as much
as 60% to the September sea ice extent decline since 1979, by warming and moistening the lower atmosphere

These conclusions are mainly drawn from in-situ measurements during field campaign (Perovich et al., 2002; Sturm et al.,
2002), global reanalysis products and surface observations (Screen and Simmonds, 2012; Boisvert et al., 2018;
Wang et al., 2019). The higher precipitation and snowfall could result in a thicker snowpack that allows less heat
loss to the atmosphere. More importantly, modeling studies suggest that increases in Arctic precipitation over the
21st century, particularly in late autumn and winter, are due mainly to strongly intensified local surface evaporation
(latent heat flux) (Bintanja and Selten, 2014). Therefore, we believe that Arctic precipitation exerts direct influence
on sea ice variations (arrow i), while sea ice modulates precipitation mainly through sensible plus latent heat flux
(arrows h, b). Among these studies, very few of them have demonstrated the delayed impact of one variable on another.
Specifically, the net shortwave flux at the surface in early summer (Mayâ€“July) is found to enhance sea ice melt with a
lag of 1â€“4 months (Choi et al., 2014). Moreover, the sea ice condition exhibits the delayed impacts on itself, which is
called sea ice anomaly persistence (Guemas et al., 2016; Cruz-GarcÃ­a et al., 2019; Holland et al., 2019). The sea ice
anomaly persistence depends on the predictand (area, extent, volume), region, and the initial and target dates, which
can be varied from a few days to a few years (Guemas et al., 2016). With sea ice anomaly persistence,
there is predictability for the sea ice area in winter but low predictability throughout the rest of the year in
peripheral seas. Based on multiple model simulations, the Labrador Sea stands out among the considered regions,
with sea ice predictability extending up to 1.5 years (Cruz-GarcÃ­a et al., 2019). Note that most of studies mentioned
above determine the changes in one variable, happening before another one, by applying time series analysis and/or
composite analysis based on observations, reanalysis or model output (Perovich et al., 2002; Sturm et al., 2002; Kay
and Gettelman, 2009; Wang et al., 2009; Nussbaumer and Pinker, 2012; Kapsch et al., 2013; Choi et al., 2014; Boisvert

2018; Wang et al., 2019). Among them, some studies use more advanced statistical analysis such as empirical orthogonal
function (Watanabe et al., 2006; Overland and Wang, 2010) and self-organizing map (Kapsch et al., 2019; Rinke et al.,
2019). Other studies assess the causal links through targeted modeling experiments (Bintanja and Selten, 2014; Kapsch
et al., 2016; Ding et al., 2017; Huang et al., 2019a; Cruz-GarcÃ­a et al., 2019), in order to test whether a manipulation
of one variable has an impact on others. And most of the studies focus on relationships between only one or two

(Ding et al., 2017; Huang et al., 2021; Luo et al., 2021). On the other hand, the reduction in Arctic sea ice extent
and increase in open water area in late summer are found to directly contribute to a modification of large-scale

Huang et al. Arctic Sea Ice Causality Discovery circulation patterns in the following autumn through the additional
heat stored in the Arctic Ocean and released to the atmosphere during the autumn (Overland and Wang, 2010). The
increased 1,000â€“500 hPa thickness in autumn produce anomalous easterley zonal wind component (u-component), especially
over the north of Alaska and Canada. Moreover, a more meridional flow pattern associated with sea ice reduction have
an impact on the mid-latitude weather (Overland and Wang, 2010). These conclusions are mainly drawn from model
simulations (Watanabe et al., 2006; Rinke et al., 2019), reanalysis and observations (Wang et al., 2009; Overland and
Wang, 2010; Kapsch et al., 2019). In addition to radiation, the sensible plus latent heat flux also plays an important
role in the Arctic energy budget. The increase in the downward moisture flux triggers the melting of the sea ice in
spring (Boisvert et al., 2015; Boisvert and Stroeve, 2015; Marcovecchio et al., 2021). Earlier melt onset and loss of
sea ice in the spring enhance warming of the ice-free ocean surface, which in turn leads to an increase of evaporation
from the surface into the atmosphere in the autumn. This positive feedback between heat flux and sea ice, indicated
by arrow h, has been confirmed by satellite observations (Boisvert et al., 2015; Boisvert and Stroeve, 2015) and model
simulations (Huang et al., 2019a) during most months of the year. The arrow i represents the influence of precipitation
on Arctic sea ice variations. Specifically, the magnitude of precipitation accumulating over the sea ice pack largely
determines the depth of the snow layer, which modulates the rate of sea ice growth because of its highly insulating
properties (Sturm et al., 2002). The phase of the precipitation falling on the sea ice pack is also important. As rain,
it can melt, compact, and densify the snowpack, thus reducing the surface albedo and promoting sea ice melt (Perovich
et al., 2002).The recent snowfall decline in summer is essentially caused by changes in precipitation form (snow
turning to rain) with very little influence of decreases in total precipitation, which is a result of
lower-atmospheric warming. Then the loss of snow-on-ice results in a substantial decrease in the surface albedo over
the Arctic Ocean, causing additional surface ice melt by absorbing more solar radiation (Screen and Simmonds, 2012).

CAUSALITY BETWEEN ATMOSPHERIC PROCESSES AND ARCTIC SEA ICE VARIATIONS
Due to the two-way interactions between the atmosphere and sea ice, studying causality between them is a challenging but
important task, which makes it an area of high interest within polar climate community. The sea ice variations can be
caused by different dynamical and thermodynamical processes. Important dynamical processes include anomalous surface
wind (Spreen et al., 2011; Wu et al., 2012), regional atmospheric circulation patterns (Overland and Wang, 2010;
Screen et al., 2018; Rinke et al., 2019) and abnormal storm activities (Simmonds et al., 2008; Simmonds and Keay, 2009;
Screen et al., 2011; Simmonds and Rudeva, 2012; Parkinson and Comiso, 2013; Simmonds and Rudeva, 2014). Cloud (Kapsch
et al., 2013), radiation (Kay and Gettelman, 2009; Choi et al., 2014) and precipitation (Boisvert et al., 2018; Wang
et al., 2019; Marcovecchio et al., 2021) are the important thermodynamic factors controlling Arctic sea ice trends
and variability. On the other hand, sea ice decline in turn exerts large influence on the atmosphere, including
cloud (Kay and Gettelman, 2009; Morrison et al., 2018), surface energy budget (Semmler et al., 2012; Boisvert et al.,
2015; Boisvert and Stroeve, 2015), precipitation (Bintanja and Selten, 2014; Kopec et al., 2016) and large-scale
circulation (Chemke et al., 2019; Kennel and Yulaeva, 2020). Figure 1 depicts the causal relations between key
atmospheric variables and sea ice over the Arctic. The sea ice here represents sea ice coverage and/or sea ice
thickness. Note that the processes a âˆ’ d are well-known atmospheric processes, including cloud microphysics,
thermodynamics, radiation, climate dynamics, which have been studied over the past few decades. The processes
e âˆ’ i are summarized from more recent publications, which are still under investigation by climate scientists.
We will explain processes e âˆ’ i in details in the next paragraph. The arrow e represents the two-way effect between
sea ice and net longwave flux at the surface. Based on global reanalysis (Kapsch et al., 2013; Lee et al., 2017),
surface (Cox et al., 2016) and satellite observations (Huang et al., 2017), as well as model simulations (Kapsch et
al., 2016; Huang et al., 2019a), the downward longwave radiation at the surface dominates surface warming and
therefore enhances sea ice melt in winter and spring. The increase in downward longwave flux is a result of an
increase in cloudiness and moisture in the Arctic Basin, which is caused by enhanced local evaporation or moisture
transport from mid-latitudes (Luo et al., 2017). Positive anomalies of longwave flux in spring and early summer
initiate an earlier melt onset, thereby triggering several feedback mechanisms which amplify melt during the
succeeding months (Kapsch et al., 2016; Huang et al., 2019b). The sea ice melt increases the air temperature

atmospheric processes with changes in Arctic sea ice. Therefore, in this study, we target to provide a more
comprehensive analysis about causality between multiple atmospheric processes and sea ice by applying different
data-driven causality approaches.

According to the context, the arrow e in Figure 1 represents the two-way effect between sea ice and net longwave flux at the surface. It states that the downward longwave radiation at the surface dominates surface warming and enhances sea ice melt in winter and spring.

(Ding et al., 2017; Huang et al., 2021; Luo et al., 2021). On the other hand, the reduction in Arctic sea ice extent

Huang et al. Arctic Sea Ice Causality Discovery circulation patterns in the following autumn through the additional
heat stored in the Arctic Ocean and released to the atmosphere during the autumn (Overland and Wang, 2010). The
increased 1,000â€“500 hPa thickness in autumn produce anomalous easterley zonal wind component (u-component), especially
over the north of Alaska and Canada. Moreover, a more meridional flow pattern associated with sea ice reduction have
an impact on the mid-latitude weather (Overland and Wang, 2010). These conclusions are mainly drawn from model
simulations (Watanabe et al., 2006; Rinke et al., 2019), reanalysis and observations (Wang et al., 2009; Overland and
Wang, 2010; Kapsch et al., 2019). In addition to radiation, the sensible plus latent heat flux also plays an important
role in the Arctic energy budget. The increase in the downward moisture flux triggers the melting of the sea ice in
spring (Boisvert et al., 2015; Boisvert and Stroeve, 2015; Marcovecchio et al., 2021). Earlier melt onset and loss of
sea ice in the spring enhance warming of the ice-free ocean surface, which in turn leads to an increase of evaporation
from the surface into the atmosphere in the autumn. This positive feedback between heat flux and sea ice, indicated
by arrow h, has been confirmed by satellite observations (Boisvert et al., 2015; Boisvert and Stroeve, 2015) and model
simulations (Huang et al., 2019a) during most months of the year. The arrow i represents the influence of precipitation
on Arctic sea ice variations. Specifically, the magnitude of precipitation accumulating over the sea ice pack largely
determines the depth of the snow layer, which modulates the rate of sea ice growth because of its highly insulating
properties (Sturm et al., 2002). The phase of the precipitation falling on the sea ice pack is also important. As rain,
it can melt, compact, and densify the snowpack, thus reducing the surface albedo and promoting sea ice melt (Perovich
et al., 2002).The recent snowfall decline in summer is essentially caused by changes in precipitation form (snow
turning to rain) with very little influence of decreases in total precipitation, which is a result of
lower-atmospheric warming. Then the loss of snow-on-ice results in a substantial decrease in the surface albedo over
the Arctic Ocean, causing additional surface ice melt by absorbing more solar radiation (Screen and Simmonds, 2012).

CAUSALITY BETWEEN ATMOSPHERIC PROCESSES AND ARCTIC SEA ICE VARIATIONS
Due to the two-way interactions between the atmosphere and sea ice, studying causality between them is a challenging but
important task, which makes it an area of high interest within polar climate community. The sea ice variations can be
caused by different dynamical and thermodynamical processes. Important dynamical processes include anomalous surface
wind (Spreen et al., 2011; Wu et al., 2012), regional atmospheric circulation patterns (Overland and Wang, 2010;
Screen et al., 2018; Rinke et al., 2019) and abnormal storm activities (Simmonds et al., 2008; Simmonds and Keay, 2009;
Screen et al., 2011; Simmonds and Rudeva, 2012; Parkinson and Comiso, 2013; Simmonds and Rudeva, 2014). Cloud (Kapsch
et al., 2013), radiation (Kay and Gettelman, 2009; Choi et al., 2014) and precipitation (Boisvert et al., 2018; Wang
et al., 2019; Marcovecchio et al., 2021) are the important thermodynamic factors controlling Arctic sea ice trends
and variability. On the other hand, sea ice decline in turn exerts large influence on the atmosphere, including
cloud (Kay and Gettelman, 2009; Morrison et al., 2018), surface energy budget (Semmler et al., 2012; Boisvert et al.,
2015; Boisvert and Stroeve, 2015), precipitation (Bintanja and Selten, 2014; Kopec et al., 2016) and large-scale
circulation (Chemke et al., 2019; Kennel and Yulaeva, 2020). Figure 1 depicts the causal relations between key
atmospheric variables and sea ice over the Arctic. The sea ice here represents sea ice coverage and/or sea ice
thickness. Note that the processes a âˆ’ d are well-known atmospheric processes, including cloud microphysics,
thermodynamics, radiation, climate dynamics, which have been studied over the past few decades. The processes
e âˆ’ i are summarized from more recent publications, which are still under investigation by climate scientists.
We will explain processes e âˆ’ i in details in the next paragraph. The arrow e represents the two-way effect between
sea ice and net longwave flux at the surface. Based on global reanalysis (Kapsch et al., 2013; Lee et al., 2017),
surface (Cox et al., 2016) and satellite observations (Huang et al., 2017), as well as model simulations (Kapsch et
al., 2016; Huang et al., 2019a), the downward longwave radiation at the surface dominates surface warming and
therefore enhances sea ice melt in winter and spring. The increase in downward longwave flux is a result of an
increase in cloudiness and moisture in the Arctic Basin, which is caused by enhanced local evaporation or moisture
transport from mid-latitudes (Luo et al., 2017). Positive anomalies of longwave flux in spring and early summer
initiate an earlier melt onset, thereby triggering several feedback mechanisms which amplify melt during the
succeeding months (Kapsch et al., 2016; Huang et al., 2019b). The sea ice melt increases the air temperature

atmospheric processes with changes in Arctic sea ice. Therefore, in this study, we target to provide a more
comprehensive analysis about causality between multiple atmospheric processes and sea ice by applying different
data-driven causality approaches.

Huang et al. Arctic Sea Ice Causality Discovery surface. The downward shortwave flux, however, appears only
important after the melt has started (Kapsch et al., 2013; Huang et al., 2017). Once the surface albedo is
significantly reduced due to sea ice melt, the solar radiation could be absorbed by ocean, which further
accelerates ice melt in late spring and summer (Kay and Gettelman, 2009; Choi et al., 2014; Kapsch et al., 2016).
The feedback between surface net shortwave flux and sea ice, represented by arrow f in Figure 1, has been
confirmed by both model simulations (Kapsch et al., 2016) and satellite observations (Kay and Gettelman, 2009;
Nussbaumer and Pinker, 2012; Choi et al., 2014). The arrows g indicate the interactions between the sea ice variations
and atmospheric dynamical processes. A series of studies demonstrated that recent loss of Arctic sea ice is triggered
by the atmospheric circulation changes such as a tendency toward a dipole pattern in the mean sea level pressure trend
with an increase over the Arctic Ocean and a decrease over Siberia. The Arctic dipole anomaly in summer
(Wang et al., 2009), winter (Watanabe et al., 2006) and spring (Kapsch et al., 2019) produces a strong meridional
wind (v-component) anomaly that drives more sea ice out of the Arctic Ocean. In addition, this dipole anomaly promotes
transport of heat and moisture and thus enhances downward longwave radiation and control the melt onset
(Huang et al., 2019b; Kapsch et al., 2019). Moreover, the changes in cyclone occurrence and/or depth during spring
(Screen et al., 2011) and summer (Simmonds and Rudeva, 2012) have preconditioning effects on the sea ice cover and
exert a strong influence on the amount of sea ice that survives the melt season. A recent study also pointed out that
a stronger anticyclonic circulation over Greenland and the Arctic Ocean in the troposphere may have contributed as much
as 60% to the September sea ice extent decline since 1979, by warming and moistening the lower atmosphere

These conclusions are mainly drawn from in-situ measurements during field campaign (Perovich et al., 2002; Sturm et al.,
2002), global reanalysis products and surface observations (Screen and Simmonds, 2012; Boisvert et al., 2018;
Wang et al., 2019). The higher precipitation and snowfall could result in a thicker snowpack that allows less heat
loss to the atmosphere. More importantly, modeling studies suggest that increases in Arctic precipitation over the
21st century, particularly in late autumn and winter, are due mainly to strongly intensified local surface evaporation
(latent heat flux) (Bintanja and Selten, 2014). Therefore, we believe that Arctic precipitation exerts direct influence
on sea ice variations (arrow i), while sea ice modulates precipitation mainly through sensible plus latent heat flux
(arrows h, b). Among these studies, very few of them have demonstrated the delayed impact of one variable on another.
Specifically, the net shortwave flux at the surface in early summer (Mayâ€“July) is found to enhance sea ice melt with a
lag of 1â€“4 months (Choi et al., 2014). Moreover, the sea ice condition exhibits the delayed impacts on itself, which is
called sea ice anomaly persistence (Guemas et al., 2016; Cruz-GarcÃ­a et al., 2019; Holland et al., 2019). The sea ice
anomaly persistence depends on the predictand (area, extent, volume), region, and the initial and target dates, which
can be varied from a few days to a few years (Guemas et al., 2016). With sea ice anomaly persistence,
there is predictability for the sea ice area in winter but low predictability throughout the rest of the year in
peripheral seas. Based on multiple model simulations, the Labrador Sea stands out among the considered regions,
with sea ice predictability extending up to 1.5 years (Cruz-GarcÃ­a et al., 2019). Note that most of studies mentioned
above determine the changes in one variable, happening before another one, by applying time series analysis and/or
composite analysis based on observations, reanalysis or model output (Perovich et al., 2002; Sturm et al., 2002; Kay

Huang et al. Arctic Sea Ice Causality Discovery circulation patterns in the following autumn through the additional

increased 1,000â€“500 hPa thickness in autumn produce anomalous easterley zonal wind component (u-component), especially

properties (Sturm et al., 2002). The phase of the precipitation falling on the sea ice pack is also important. As rain,
it can melt, compact, and densify the snowpack, thus reducing the surface albedo and promoting sea ice melt (Perovich
et al., 2002).The recent snowfall decline in summer is essentially caused by changes in precipitation form (snow
turning to rain) with very little influence of decreases in total precipitation, which is a result of
lower-atmospheric warming. Then the loss of snow-on-ice results in a substantial decrease in the surface albedo over
the Arctic Ocean, causing additional surface ice melt by absorbing more solar radiation (Screen and Simmonds, 2012).

CAUSALITY BETWEEN ATMOSPHERIC PROCESSES AND ARCTIC SEA ICE VARIATIONS
Due to the two-way interactions between the atmosphere and sea ice, studying causality between them is a challenging but
important task, which makes it an area of high interest within polar climate community. The sea ice variations can be
caused by different dynamical and thermodynamical processes. Important dynamical processes include anomalous surface
wind (Spreen et al., 2011; Wu et al., 2012), regional atmospheric circulation patterns (Overland and Wang, 2010;
Screen et al., 2018; Rinke et al., 2019) and abnormal storm activities (Simmonds et al., 2008; Simmonds and Keay, 2009;
Screen et al., 2011; Simmonds and Rudeva, 2012; Parkinson and Comiso, 2013; Simmonds and Rudeva, 2014). Cloud (Kapsch
et al., 2013), radiation (Kay and Gettelman, 2009; Choi et al., 2014) and precipitation (Boisvert et al., 2018; Wang
et al., 2019; Marcovecchio et al., 2021) are the important thermodynamic factors controlling Arctic sea ice trends
and variability. On the other hand, sea ice decline in turn exerts large influence on the atmosphere, including
cloud (Kay and Gettelman, 2009; Morrison et al., 2018), surface energy budget (Semmler et al., 2012; Boisvert et al.,
2015; Boisvert and Stroeve, 2015), precipitation (Bintanja and Selten, 2014; Kopec et al., 2016) and large-scale
circulation (Chemke et al., 2019; Kennel and Yulaeva, 2020). Figure 1 depicts the causal relations between key
atmospheric variables and sea ice over the Arctic. The sea ice here represents sea ice coverage and/or sea ice
thickness. Note that the processes a âˆ’ d are well-known atmospheric processes, including cloud microphysics,
thermodynamics, radiation, climate dynamics, which have been studied over the past few decades. The processes
e âˆ’ i are summarized from more recent publications, which are still under investigation by climate scientists.
We will explain processes e âˆ’ i in details in the next paragraph. The arrow e represents the two-way effect between
sea ice and net longwave flux at the surface. Based on global reanalysis (Kapsch et al., 2013; Lee et al., 2017),
surface (Cox et al., 2016) and satellite observations (Huang et al., 2017), as well as model simulations (Kapsch et
al., 2016; Huang et al., 2019a), the downward longwave radiation at the surface dominates surface warming and
therefore enhances sea ice melt in winter and spring. The increase in downward longwave flux is a result of an
increase in cloudiness and moisture in the Arctic Basin, which is caused by enhanced local evaporation or moisture
transport from mid-latitudes (Luo et al., 2017). Positive anomalies of longwave flux in spring and early summer
initiate an earlier melt onset, thereby triggering several feedback mechanisms which amplify melt during the
succeeding months (Kapsch et al., 2016; Huang et al., 2019b). The sea ice melt increases the air temperature

atmospheric processes with changes in Arctic sea ice. Therefore, in this study, we target to provide a more
comprehensive analysis about causality between multiple atmospheric processes and sea ice by applying different
data-driven causality approaches.

Huang et al. Arctic Sea Ice Causality Discovery surface. The downward shortwave flux, however, appears only
important after the melt has started (Kapsch et al., 2013; Huang et al., 2017). Once the surface albedo is
significantly reduced due to sea ice melt, the solar radiation could be absorbed by ocean, which further
accelerates ice melt in late spring and summer (Kay and Gettelman, 2009; Choi et al., 2014; Kapsch et al., 2016).
The feedback between surface net shortwave flux and sea ice, represented by arrow f in Figure 1, has been
confirmed by both model simulations (Kapsch et al., 2016) and satellite observations (Kay and Gettelman, 2009;
Nussbaumer and Pinker, 2012; Choi et al., 2014). The arrows g indicate the interactions between the sea ice variations
and atmospheric dynamical processes. A series of studies demonstrated that recent loss of Arctic sea ice is triggered
by the atmospheric circulation changes such as a tendency toward a dipole pattern in the mean sea level pressure trend
with an increase over the Arctic Ocean and a decrease over Siberia. The Arctic dipole anomaly in summer
(Wang et al., 2009), winter (Watanabe et al., 2006) and spring (Kapsch et al., 2019) produces a strong meridional
wind (v-component) anomaly that drives more sea ice out of the Arctic Ocean. In addition, this dipole anomaly promotes
transport of heat and moisture and thus enhances downward longwave radiation and control the melt onset
(Huang et al., 2019b; Kapsch et al., 2019). Moreover, the changes in cyclone occurrence and/or depth during spring
(Screen et al., 2011) and summer (Simmonds and Rudeva, 2012) have preconditioning effects on the sea ice cover and
exert a strong influence on the amount of sea ice that survives the melt season. A recent study also pointed out that
a stronger anticyclonic circulation over Greenland and the Arctic Ocean in the troposphere may have contributed as much
as 60% to the September sea ice extent decline since 1979, by warming and moistening the lower atmosphere

These conclusions are mainly drawn from in-situ measurements during field campaign (Perovich et al., 2002; Sturm et al.,
2002), global reanalysis products and surface observations (Screen and Simmonds, 2012; Boisvert et al., 2018;
Wang et al., 2019). The higher precipitation and snowfall could result in a thicker snowpack that allows less heat
loss to the atmosphere. More importantly, modeling studies suggest that increases in Arctic precipitation over the
21st century, particularly in late autumn and winter, are due mainly to strongly intensified local surface evaporation
(latent heat flux) (Bintanja and Selten, 2014). Therefore, we believe that Arctic precipitation exerts direct influence
on sea ice variations (arrow i), while sea ice modulates precipitation mainly through sensible plus latent heat flux
(arrows h, b). Among these studies, very few of them have demonstrated the delayed impact of one variable on another.
Specifically, the net shortwave flux at the surface in early summer (Mayâ€“July) is found to enhance sea ice melt with a
lag of 1â€“4 months (Choi et al., 2014). Moreover, the sea ice condition exhibits the delayed impacts on itself, which is
called sea ice anomaly persistence (Guemas et al., 2016; Cruz-GarcÃ­a et al., 2019; Holland et al., 2019). The sea ice
anomaly persistence depends on the predictand (area, extent, volume), region, and the initial and target dates, which
can be varied from a few days to a few years (Guemas et al., 2016). With sea ice anomaly persistence,
there is predictability for the sea ice area in winter but low predictability throughout the rest of the year in
peripheral seas. Based on multiple model simulations, the Labrador Sea stands out among the considered regions,
with sea ice predictability extending up to 1.5 years (Cruz-GarcÃ­a et al., 2019). Note that most of studies mentioned
above determine the changes in one variable, happening before another one, by applying time series analysis and/or
composite analysis based on observations, reanalysis or model output (Perovich et al., 2002; Sturm et al., 2002; Kay
and Gettelman, 2009; Wang et al., 2009; Nussbaumer and Pinker, 2012; Kapsch et al., 2013; Choi et al., 2014; Boisvert
et al., 2015; Boisvert and Stroeve, 2015; Cox et al., 2016; Huang et al., 2017; Huang et al., 2019b; Boisvert et al.,
2018; Wang et al., 2019). Among them, some studies use more advanced statistical analysis such as empirical orthogonal
function (Watanabe et al., 2006; Overland and Wang, 2010) and self-organizing map (Kapsch et al., 2019; Rinke et al.,
2019). Other studies assess the causal links through targeted modeling experiments (Bintanja and Selten, 2014; Kapsch
et al., 2016; Ding et al., 2017; Huang et al., 2019a; Cruz-GarcÃ­a et al., 2019), in order to test whether a manipulation
of one variable has an impact on others. And most of the studies focus on relationships between only one or two

(Ding et al., 2017; Huang et al., 2021; Luo et al., 2021). On the other hand, the reduction in Arctic sea ice extent
and increase in open water area in late summer are found to directly contribute to a modification of large-scale

Huang et al. Arctic Sea Ice Causality Discovery circulation patterns in the following autumn through the additional
heat stored in the Arctic Ocean and released to the atmosphere during the autumn (Overland and Wang, 2010). The
increased 1,000â€“500 hPa thickness in autumn produce anomalous easterley zonal wind component (u-component), especially
over the north of Alaska and Canada. Moreover, a more meridional flow pattern associated with sea ice reduction have
an impact on the mid-latitude weather (Overland and Wang, 2010). These conclusions are mainly drawn from model
simulations (Watanabe et al., 2006; Rinke et al., 2019), reanalysis and observations (Wang et al., 2009; Overland and
Wang, 2010; Kapsch et al., 2019). In addition to radiation, the sensible plus latent heat flux also plays an important
role in the Arctic energy budget. The increase in the downward moisture flux triggers the melting of the sea ice in
spring (Boisvert et al., 2015; Boisvert and Stroeve, 2015; Marcovecchio et al., 2021). Earlier melt onset and loss of
sea ice in the spring enhance warming of the ice-free ocean surface, which in turn leads to an increase of evaporation
from the surface into the atmosphere in the autumn. This positive feedback between heat flux and sea ice, indicated
by arrow h, has been confirmed by satellite observations (Boisvert et al., 2015; Boisvert and Stroeve, 2015) and model
simulations (Huang et al., 2019a) during most months of the year. The arrow i represents the influence of precipitation
on Arctic sea ice variations. Specifically, the magnitude of precipitation accumulating over the sea ice pack largely
determines the depth of the snow layer, which modulates the rate of sea ice growth because of its highly insulating

al., 2016; Huang et al., 2019a), the downward longwave radiation at the surface dominates surface warming and
therefore enhances sea ice melt in winter and spring. The increase in downward longwave flux is a result of an
increase in cloudiness and moisture in the Arctic Basin, which is caused by enhanced local evaporation or moisture
transport from mid-latitudes (Luo et al., 2017). Positive anomalies of longwave flux in spring and early summer
initiate an earlier melt onset, thereby triggering several feedback mechanisms which amplify melt during the
succeeding months (Kapsch et al., 2016; Huang et al., 2019b). The sea ice melt increases the air temperature

atmospheric processes with changes in Arctic sea ice. Therefore, in this study, we target to provide a more
comprehensive analysis about causality between multiple atmospheric processes and sea ice by applying different
data-driven causality approaches.

Huang et al. Arctic Sea Ice Causality Discovery surface. The downward shortwave flux, however, appears only
important after the melt has started (Kapsch et al., 2013; Huang et al., 2017). Once the surface albedo is
significantly reduced due to sea ice melt, the solar radiation could be absorbed by ocean, which further
accelerates ice melt in late spring and summer (Kay and Gettelman, 2009; Choi et al., 2014; Kapsch et al., 2016).
The feedback between surface net shortwave flux and sea ice, represented by arrow f in Figure 1, has been
confirmed by both model simulations (Kapsch et al., 2016) and satellite observations (Kay and Gettelman, 2009;
Nussbaumer and Pinker, 2012; Choi et al., 2014). The arrows g indicate the interactions between the sea ice variations
and atmospheric dynamical processes. A series of studies demonstrated that recent loss of Arctic sea ice is triggered
by the atmospheric circulation changes such as a tendency toward a dipole pattern in the mean sea level pressure trend
with an increase over the Arctic Ocean and a decrease over Siberia. The Arctic dipole anomaly in summer
(Wang et al., 2009), winter (Watanabe et al., 2006) and spring (Kapsch et al., 2019) produces a strong meridional
wind (v-component) anomaly that drives more sea ice out of the Arctic Ocean. In addition, this dipole anomaly promotes
transport of heat and moisture and thus enhances downward longwave radiation and control the melt onset
(Huang et al., 2019b; Kapsch et al., 2019). Moreover, the changes in cyclone occurrence and/or depth during spring
(Screen et al., 2011) and summer (Simmonds and Rudeva, 2012) have preconditioning effects on the sea ice cover and
exert a strong influence on the amount of sea ice that survives the melt season. A recent study also pointed out that
a stronger anticyclonic circulation over Greenland and the Arctic Ocean in the troposphere may have contributed as much
as 60% to the September sea ice extent decline since 1979, by warming and moistening the lower atmosphere

These conclusions are mainly drawn from in-situ measurements during field campaign (Perovich et al., 2002; Sturm et al.,
2002), global reanalysis products and surface observations (Screen and Simmonds, 2012; Boisvert et al., 2018;
Wang et al., 2019). The higher precipitation and snowfall could result in a thicker snowpack that allows less heat
loss to the atmosphere. More importantly, modeling studies suggest that increases in Arctic precipitation over the
21st century, particularly in late autumn and winter, are due mainly to strongly intensified local surface evaporation
(latent heat flux) (Bintanja and Selten, 2014). Therefore, we believe that Arctic precipitation exerts direct influence
on sea ice variations (arrow i), while sea ice modulates precipitation mainly through sensible plus latent heat flux
(arrows h, b). Among these studies, very few of them have demonstrated the delayed impact of one variable on another.
Specifically, the net shortwave flux at the surface in early summer (Mayâ€“July) is found to enhance sea ice melt with a
lag of 1â€“4 months (Choi et al., 2014). Moreover, the sea ice condition exhibits the delayed impacts on itself, which is
called sea ice anomaly persistence (Guemas et al., 2016; Cruz-GarcÃ­a et al., 2019; Holland et al., 2019). The sea ice
anomaly persistence depends on the predictand (area, extent, volume), region, and the initial and target dates, which
can be varied from a few days to a few years (Guemas et al., 2016). With sea ice anomaly persistence,
there is predictability for the sea ice area in winter but low predictability throughout the rest of the year in
peripheral seas. Based on multiple model simulations, the Labrador Sea stands out among the considered regions,
with sea ice predictability extending up to 1.5 years (Cruz-GarcÃ­a et al., 2019). Note that most of studies mentioned
above determine the changes in one variable, happening before another one, by applying time series analysis and/or
composite analysis based on observations, reanalysis or model output (Perovich et al., 2002; Sturm et al., 2002; Kay
and Gettelman, 2009; Wang et al., 2009; Nussbaumer and Pinker, 2012; Kapsch et al., 2013; Choi et al., 2014; Boisvert
et al., 2015; Boisvert and Stroeve, 2015; Cox et al., 2016; Huang et al., 2017; Huang et al., 2019b; Boisvert et al.,
2018; Wang et al., 2019). Among them, some studies use more advanced statistical analysis such as empirical orthogonal
function (Watanabe et al., 2006; Overland and Wang, 2010) and self-organizing map (Kapsch et al., 2019; Rinke et al.,
2019). Other studies assess the causal links through targeted modeling experiments (Bintanja and Selten, 2014; Kapsch
et al., 2016; Ding et al., 2017; Huang et al., 2019a; Cruz-GarcÃ­a et al., 2019), in order to test whether a manipulation
of one variable has an impact on others. And most of the studies focus on relationships between only one or two

(Ding et al., 2017; Huang et al., 2021; Luo et al., 2021). On the other hand, the reduction in Arctic sea ice extent
and increase in open water area in late summer are found to directly contribute to a modification of large-scale

Huang et al. Arctic Sea Ice Causality Discovery circulation patterns in the following autumn through the additional
heat stored in the Arctic Ocean and released to the atmosphere during the autumn (Overland and Wang, 2010). The
increased 1,000â€“500 hPa thickness in autumn produce anomalous easterley zonal wind component (u-component), especially
over the north of Alaska and Canada. Moreover, a more meridional flow pattern associated with sea ice reduction have
an impact on the mid-latitude weather (Overland and Wang, 2010). These conclusions are mainly drawn from model
simulations (Watanabe et al., 2006; Rinke et al., 2019), reanalysis and observations (Wang et al., 2009; Overland and
Wang, 2010; Kapsch et al., 2019). In addition to radiation, the sensible plus latent heat flux also plays an important
role in the Arctic energy budget. The increase in the downward moisture flux triggers the melting of the sea ice in
spring (Boisvert et al., 2015; Boisvert and Stroeve, 2015; Marcovecchio et al., 2021). Earlier melt onset and loss of
sea ice in the spring enhance warming of the ice-free ocean surface, which in turn leads to an increase of evaporation
from the surface into the atmosphere in the autumn. This positive feedback between heat flux and sea ice, indicated
by arrow h, has been confirmed by satellite observations (Boisvert et al., 2015; Boisvert and Stroeve, 2015) and model
simulations (Huang et al., 2019a) during most months of the year. The arrow i represents the influence of precipitation
on Arctic sea ice variations. Specifically, the magnitude of precipitation accumulating over the sea ice pack largely
determines the depth of the snow layer, which modulates the rate of sea ice growth because of its highly insulating
properties (Sturm et al., 2002). The phase of the precipitation falling on the sea ice pack is also important. As rain,
it can melt, compact, and densify the snowpack, thus reducing the surface albedo and promoting sea ice melt (Perovich
et al., 2002).The recent snowfall decline in summer is essentially caused by changes in precipitation form (snow
turning to rain) with very little influence of decreases in total precipitation, which is a result of
lower-atmospheric warming. Then the loss of snow-on-ice results in a substantial decrease in the surface albedo over
the Arctic Ocean, causing additional surface ice melt by absorbing more solar radiation (Screen and Simmonds, 2012).

CAUSALITY BETWEEN ATMOSPHERIC PROCESSES AND ARCTIC SEA ICE VARIATIONS
Due to the two-way interactions between the atmosphere and sea ice, studying causality between them is a challenging but
important task, which makes it an area of high interest within polar climate community. The sea ice variations can be
caused by different dynamical and thermodynamical processes. Important dynamical processes include anomalous surface
wind (Spreen et al., 2011; Wu et al., 2012), regional atmospheric circulation patterns (Overland and Wang, 2010;
Screen et al., 2018; Rinke et al., 2019) and abnormal storm activities (Simmonds et al., 2008; Simmonds and Keay, 2009;
Screen et al., 2011; Simmonds and Rudeva, 2012; Parkinson and Comiso, 2013; Simmonds and Rudeva, 2014). Cloud (Kapsch
et al., 2013), radiation (Kay and Gettelman, 2009; Choi et al., 2014) and precipitation (Boisvert et al., 2018; Wang
et al., 2019; Marcovecchio et al., 2021) are the important thermodynamic factors controlling Arctic sea ice trends
and variability. On the other hand, sea ice decline in turn exerts large influence on the atmosphere, including
cloud (Kay and Gettelman, 2009; Morrison et al., 2018), surface energy budget (Semmler et al., 2012; Boisvert et al.,
2015; Boisvert and Stroeve, 2015), precipitation (Bintanja and Selten, 2014; Kopec et al., 2016) and large-scale
circulation (Chemke et al., 2019; Kennel and Yulaeva, 2020). Figure 1 depicts the causal relations between key
atmospheric variables and sea ice over the Arctic. The sea ice here represents sea ice coverage and/or sea ice
thickness. Note that the processes a âˆ’ d are well-known atmospheric processes, including cloud microphysics,
thermodynamics, radiation, climate dynamics, which have been studied over the past few decades. The processes
e âˆ’ i are summarized from more recent publications, which are still under investigation by climate scientists.
We will explain processes e âˆ’ i in details in the next paragraph. The arrow e represents the two-way effect between
sea ice and net longwave flux at the surface. Based on global reanalysis (Kapsch et al., 2013; Lee et al., 2017),
surface (Cox et al., 2016) and satellite observations (Huang et al., 2017), as well as model simulations (Kapsch et

confirmed by both model simulations (Kapsch et al., 2016) and satellite observations (Kay and Gettelman, 2009;
Nussbaumer and Pinker, 2012; Choi et al., 2014). The arrows g indicate the interactions between the sea ice variations
and atmospheric dynamical processes. A series of studies demonstrated that recent loss of Arctic sea ice is triggered
by the atmospheric circulation changes such as a tendency toward a dipole pattern in the mean sea level pressure trend
with an increase over the Arctic Ocean and a decrease over Siberia. The Arctic dipole anomaly in summer
(Wang et al., 2009), winter (Watanabe et al., 2006) and spring (Kapsch et al., 2019) produces a strong meridional
wind (v-component) anomaly that drives more sea ice out of the Arctic Ocean. In addition, this dipole anomaly promotes
transport of heat and moisture and thus enhances downward longwave radiation and control the melt onset
(Huang et al., 2019b; Kapsch et al., 2019). Moreover, the changes in cyclone occurrence and/or depth during spring
(Screen et al., 2011) and summer (Simmonds and Rudeva, 2012) have preconditioning effects on the sea ice cover and
exert a strong influence on the amount of sea ice that survives the melt season. A recent study also pointed out that
a stronger anticyclonic circulation over Greenland and the Arctic Ocean in the troposphere may have contributed as much
as 60% to the September sea ice extent decline since 1979, by warming and moistening the lower atmosphere

These conclusions are mainly drawn from in-situ measurements during field campaign (Perovich et al., 2002; Sturm et al.,
2002), global reanalysis products and surface observations (Screen and Simmonds, 2012; Boisvert et al., 2018;
Wang et al., 2019). The higher precipitation and snowfall could result in a thicker snowpack that allows less heat
loss to the atmosphere. More importantly, modeling studies suggest that increases in Arctic precipitation over the
21st century, particularly in late autumn and winter, are due mainly to strongly intensified local surface evaporation
(latent heat flux) (Bintanja and Selten, 2014). Therefore, we believe that Arctic precipitation exerts direct influence
on sea ice variations (arrow i), while sea ice modulates precipitation mainly through sensible plus latent heat flux
(arrows h, b). Among these studies, very few of them have demonstrated the delayed impact of one variable on another.
Specifically, the net shortwave flux at the surface in early summer (Mayâ€“July) is found to enhance sea ice melt with a
lag of 1â€“4 months (Choi et al., 2014). Moreover, the sea ice condition exhibits the delayed impacts on itself, which is
called sea ice anomaly persistence (Guemas et al., 2016; Cruz-GarcÃ­a et al., 2019; Holland et al., 2019). The sea ice
anomaly persistence depends on the predictand (area, extent, volume), region, and the initial and target dates, which
can be varied from a few days to a few years (Guemas et al., 2016). With sea ice anomaly persistence,
there is predictability for the sea ice area in winter but low predictability throughout the rest of the year in
peripheral seas. Based on multiple model simulations, the Labrador Sea stands out among the considered regions,
with sea ice predictability extending up to 1.5 years (Cruz-GarcÃ­a et al., 2019). Note that most of studies mentioned
above determine the changes in one variable, happening before another one, by applying time series analysis and/or
composite analysis based on observations, reanalysis or model output (Perovich et al., 2002; Sturm et al., 2002; Kay
and Gettelman, 2009; Wang et al., 2009; Nussbaumer and Pinker, 2012; Kapsch et al., 2013; Choi et al., 2014; Boisvert
et al., 2015; Boisvert and Stroeve, 2015; Cox et al., 2016; Huang et al., 2017; Huang et al., 2019b; Boisvert et al.,
2018; Wang et al., 2019). Among them, some studies use more advanced statistical analysis such as empirical orthogonal
function (Watanabe et al., 2006; Overland and Wang, 2010) and self-organizing map (Kapsch et al., 2019; Rinke et al.,
2019). Other studies assess the causal links through targeted modeling experiments (Bintanja and Selten, 2014; Kapsch
et al., 2016; Ding et al., 2017; Huang et al., 2019a; Cruz-GarcÃ­a et al., 2019), in order to test whether a manipulation
of one variable has an impact on others. And most of the studies focus on relationships between only one or two

(Ding et al., 2017; Huang et al., 2021; Luo et al., 2021). On the other hand, the reduction in Arctic sea ice extent
and increase in open water area in late summer are found to directly contribute to a modification of large-scale

Huang et al. Arctic Sea Ice Causality Discovery circulation patterns in the following autumn through the additional
heat stored in the Arctic Ocean and released to the atmosphere during the autumn (Overland and Wang, 2010). The
increased 1,000â€“500 hPa thickness in autumn produce anomalous easterley zonal wind component (u-component), especially
over the north of Alaska and Canada. Moreover, a more meridional flow pattern associated with sea ice reduction have
an impact on the mid-latitude weather (Overland and Wang, 2010). These conclusions are mainly drawn from model
simulations (Watanabe et al., 2006; Rinke et al., 2019), reanalysis and observations (Wang et al., 2009; Overland and
Wang, 2010; Kapsch et al., 2019). In addition to radiation, the sensible plus latent heat flux also plays an important
role in the Arctic energy budget. The increase in the downward moisture flux triggers the melting of the sea ice in
spring (Boisvert et al., 2015; Boisvert and Stroeve, 2015; Marcovecchio et al., 2021). Earlier melt onset and loss of
sea ice in the spring enhance warming of the ice-free ocean surface, which in turn leads to an increase of evaporation
from the surface into the atmosphere in the autumn. This positive feedback between heat flux and sea ice, indicated
by arrow h, has been confirmed by satellite observations (Boisvert et al., 2015; Boisvert and Stroeve, 2015) and model
simulations (Huang et al., 2019a) during most months of the year. The arrow i represents the influence of precipitation
on Arctic sea ice variations. Specifically, the magnitude of precipitation accumulating over the sea ice pack largely
determines the depth of the snow layer, which modulates the rate of sea ice growth because of its highly insulating
properties (Sturm et al., 2002). The phase of the precipitation falling on the sea ice pack is also important. As rain,
it can melt, compact, and densify the snowpack, thus reducing the surface albedo and promoting sea ice melt (Perovich
et al., 2002).The recent snowfall decline in summer is essentially caused by changes in precipitation form (snow
turning to rain) with very little influence of decreases in total precipitation, which is a result of
lower-atmospheric warming. Then the loss of snow-on-ice results in a substantial decrease in the surface albedo over
the Arctic Ocean, causing additional surface ice melt by absorbing more solar radiation (Screen and Simmonds, 2012).

CAUSALITY BETWEEN ATMOSPHERIC PROCESSES AND ARCTIC SEA ICE VARIATIONS
Due to the two-way interactions between the atmosphere and sea ice, studying causality between them is a challenging but
important task, which makes it an area of high interest within polar climate community. The sea ice variations can be
caused by different dynamical and thermodynamical processes. Important dynamical processes include anomalous surface
wind (Spreen et al., 2011; Wu et al., 2012), regional atmospheric circulation patterns (Overland and Wang, 2010;
Screen et al., 2018; Rinke et al., 2019) and abnormal storm activities (Simmonds et al., 2008; Simmonds and Keay, 2009;
Screen et al., 2011; Simmonds and Rudeva, 2012; Parkinson and Comiso, 2013; Simmonds and Rudeva, 2014). Cloud (Kapsch
et al., 2013), radiation (Kay and Gettelman, 2009; Choi et al., 2014) and precipitation (Boisvert et al., 2018; Wang
et al., 2019; Marcovecchio et al., 2021) are the important thermodynamic factors controlling Arctic sea ice trends
and variability. On the other hand, sea ice decline in turn exerts large influence on the atmosphere, including
cloud (Kay and Gettelman, 2009; Morrison et al., 2018), surface energy budget (Semmler et al., 2012; Boisvert et al.,
2015; Boisvert and Stroeve, 2015), precipitation (Bintanja and Selten, 2014; Kopec et al., 2016) and large-scale
circulation (Chemke et al., 2019; Kennel and Yulaeva, 2020). Figure 1 depicts the causal relations between key
atmospheric variables and sea ice over the Arctic. The sea ice here represents sea ice coverage and/or sea ice
thickness. Note that the processes a âˆ’ d are well-known atmospheric processes, including cloud microphysics,
thermodynamics, radiation, climate dynamics, which have been studied over the past few decades. The processes
e âˆ’ i are summarized from more recent publications, which are still under investigation by climate scientists.
We will explain processes e âˆ’ i in details in the next paragraph. The arrow e represents the two-way effect between
sea ice and net longwave flux at the surface. Based on global reanalysis (Kapsch et al., 2013; Lee et al., 2017),
surface (Cox et al., 2016) and satellite observations (Huang et al., 2017), as well as model simulations (Kapsch et
al., 2016; Huang et al., 2019a), the downward longwave radiation at the surface dominates surface warming and
therefore enhances sea ice melt in winter and spring. The increase in downward longwave flux is a result of an
increase in cloudiness and moisture in the Arctic Basin, which is caused by enhanced local evaporation or moisture
transport from mid-latitudes (Luo et al., 2017). Positive anomalies of longwave flux in spring and early summer
initiate an earlier melt onset, thereby triggering several feedback mechanisms which amplify melt during the
succeeding months (Kapsch et al., 2016; Huang et al., 2019b). The sea ice melt increases the air temperature

atmospheric processes with changes in Arctic sea ice. Therefore, in this study, we target to provide a more
comprehensive analysis about causality between multiple atmospheric processes and sea ice by applying different
data-driven causality approaches.

important after the melt has started (Kapsch et al., 2013; Huang et al., 2017). Once the surface albedo is

Huang et al. Arctic Sea Ice Causality Discovery circulation patterns in the following autumn through the additional
heat stored in the Arctic Ocean and released to the atmosphere during the autumn (Overland and Wang, 2010). The
increased 1,000â€“500 hPa thickness in autumn produce anomalous easterley zonal wind component (u-component), especially
over the north of Alaska and Canada. Moreover, a more meridional flow pattern associated with sea ice reduction have
an impact on the mid-latitude weather (Overland and Wang, 2010). These conclusions are mainly drawn from model
simulations (Watanabe et al., 2006; Rinke et al., 2019), reanalysis and observations (Wang et al., 2009; Overland and
Wang, 2010; Kapsch et al., 2019). In addition to radiation, the sensible plus latent heat flux also plays an important
role in the Arctic energy budget. The increase in the downward moisture flux triggers the melting of the sea ice in
spring (Boisvert et al., 2015; Boisvert and Stroeve, 2015; Marcovecchio et al., 2021). Earlier melt onset and loss of
sea ice in the spring enhance warming of the ice-free ocean surface, which in turn leads to an increase of evaporation
from the surface into the atmosphere in the autumn. This positive feedback between heat flux and sea ice, indicated
by arrow h, has been confirmed by satellite observations (Boisvert et al., 2015; Boisvert and Stroeve, 2015) and model
simulations (Huang et al., 2019a) during most months of the year. The arrow i represents the influence of precipitation
on Arctic sea ice variations. Specifically, the magnitude of precipitation accumulating over the sea ice pack largely
determines the depth of the snow layer, which modulates the rate of sea ice growth because of its highly insulating
properties (Sturm et al., 2002). The phase of the precipitation falling on the sea ice pack is also important. As rain,
it can melt, compact, and densify the snowpack, thus reducing the surface albedo and promoting sea ice melt (Perovich
et al., 2002).The recent snowfall decline in summer is essentially caused by changes in precipitation form (snow
turning to rain) with very little influence of decreases in total precipitation, which is a result of
lower-atmospheric warming. Then the loss of snow-on-ice results in a substantial decrease in the surface albedo over
the Arctic Ocean, causing additional surface ice melt by absorbing more solar radiation (Screen and Simmonds, 2012).

CAUSALITY BETWEEN ATMOSPHERIC PROCESSES AND ARCTIC SEA ICE VARIATIONS
Due to the two-way interactions between the atmosphere and sea ice, studying causality between them is a challenging but
important task, which makes it an area of high interest within polar climate community. The sea ice variations can be
caused by different dynamical and thermodynamical processes. Important dynamical processes include anomalous surface
wind (Spreen et al., 2011; Wu et al., 2012), regional atmospheric circulation patterns (Overland and Wang, 2010;
Screen et al., 2018; Rinke et al., 2019) and abnormal storm activities (Simmonds et al., 2008; Simmonds and Keay, 2009;
Screen et al., 2011; Simmonds and Rudeva, 2012; Parkinson and Comiso, 2013; Simmonds and Rudeva, 2014). Cloud (Kapsch
et al., 2013), radiation (Kay and Gettelman, 2009; Choi et al., 2014) and precipitation (Boisvert et al., 2018; Wang
et al., 2019; Marcovecchio et al., 2021) are the important thermodynamic factors controlling Arctic sea ice trends
and variability. On the other hand, sea ice decline in turn exerts large influence on the atmosphere, including
cloud (Kay and Gettelman, 2009; Morrison et al., 2018), surface energy budget (Semmler et al., 2012; Boisvert et al.,
2015; Boisvert and Stroeve, 2015), precipitation (Bintanja and Selten, 2014; Kopec et al., 2016) and large-scale
circulation (Chemke et al., 2019; Kennel and Yulaeva, 2020). Figure 1 depicts the causal relations between key
atmospheric variables and sea ice over the Arctic. The sea ice here represents sea ice coverage and/or sea ice
thickness. Note that the processes a âˆ’ d are well-known atmospheric processes, including cloud microphysics,
thermodynamics, radiation, climate dynamics, which have been studied over the past few decades. The processes
e âˆ’ i are summarized from more recent publications, which are still under investigation by climate scientists.
We will explain processes e âˆ’ i in details in the next paragraph. The arrow e represents the two-way effect between
sea ice and net longwave flux at the surface. Based on global reanalysis (Kapsch et al., 2013; Lee et al., 2017),
surface (Cox et al., 2016) and satellite observations (Huang et al., 2017), as well as model simulations (Kapsch et
al., 2016; Huang et al., 2019a), the downward longwave radiation at the surface dominates surface warming and
therefore enhances sea ice melt in winter and spring. The increase in downward longwave flux is a result of an
increase in cloudiness and moisture in the Arctic Basin, which is caused by enhanced local evaporation or moisture
transport from mid-latitudes (Luo et al., 2017). Positive anomalies of longwave flux in spring and early summer
initiate an earlier melt onset, thereby triggering several feedback mechanisms which amplify melt during the
succeeding months (Kapsch et al., 2016; Huang et al., 2019b). The sea ice melt increases the air temperature

atmospheric processes with changes in Arctic sea ice. Therefore, in this study, we target to provide a more
comprehensive analysis about causality between multiple atmospheric processes and sea ice by applying different
data-driven causality approaches.

According to the information provided, the arrow e in Figure 1 represents the two-way effect between sea ice and net longwave flux at the surface. It states that an increase in downward longwave flux is a result of an increase in cloudiness and moisture in the Arctic Basin, which is caused by enhanced local evaporation or moisture transport from mid-latitudes. This increase in downward longwave flux enhances sea ice melt in winter and spring.

Based on this information, we can conclude that relative humidity (RH) indirectly affects net longwave flux at the surface (LW) through its influence on cloudiness and moisture in the Arctic Basin. Therefore, relative humidity (RH) is not a direct cause of net longwave flux at the surface (LW).

Huang et al. Arctic Sea Ice Causality Discovery surface. The downward shortwave flux, however, appears only
important after the melt has started (Kapsch et al., 2013; Huang et al., 2017). Once the surface albedo is
significantly reduced due to sea ice melt, the solar radiation could be absorbed by ocean, which further
accelerates ice melt in late spring and summer (Kay and Gettelman, 2009; Choi et al., 2014; Kapsch et al., 2016).
The feedback between surface net shortwave flux and sea ice, represented by arrow f in Figure 1, has been
confirmed by both model simulations (Kapsch et al., 2016) and satellite observations (Kay and Gettelman, 2009;
Nussbaumer and Pinker, 2012; Choi et al., 2014). The arrows g indicate the interactions between the sea ice variations
and atmospheric dynamical processes. A series of studies demonstrated that recent loss of Arctic sea ice is triggered
by the atmospheric circulation changes such as a tendency toward a dipole pattern in the mean sea level pressure trend
with an increase over the Arctic Ocean and a decrease over Siberia. The Arctic dipole anomaly in summer
(Wang et al., 2009), winter (Watanabe et al., 2006) and spring (Kapsch et al., 2019) produces a strong meridional
wind (v-component) anomaly that drives more sea ice out of the Arctic Ocean. In addition, this dipole anomaly promotes
transport of heat and moisture and thus enhances downward longwave radiation and control the melt onset
(Huang et al., 2019b; Kapsch et al., 2019). Moreover, the changes in cyclone occurrence and/or depth during spring
(Screen et al., 2011) and summer (Simmonds and Rudeva, 2012) have preconditioning effects on the sea ice cover and
exert a strong influence on the amount of sea ice that survives the melt season. A recent study also pointed out that
a stronger anticyclonic circulation over Greenland and the Arctic Ocean in the troposphere may have contributed as much
as 60% to the September sea ice extent decline since 1979, by warming and moistening the lower atmosphere

These conclusions are mainly drawn from in-situ measurements during field campaign (Perovich et al., 2002; Sturm et al.,
2002), global reanalysis products and surface observations (Screen and Simmonds, 2012; Boisvert et al., 2018;
Wang et al., 2019). The higher precipitation and snowfall could result in a thicker snowpack that allows less heat
loss to the atmosphere. More importantly, modeling studies suggest that increases in Arctic precipitation over the
21st century, particularly in late autumn and winter, are due mainly to strongly intensified local surface evaporation
(latent heat flux) (Bintanja and Selten, 2014). Therefore, we believe that Arctic precipitation exerts direct influence
on sea ice variations (arrow i), while sea ice modulates precipitation mainly through sensible plus latent heat flux
(arrows h, b). Among these studies, very few of them have demonstrated the delayed impact of one variable on another.
Specifically, the net shortwave flux at the surface in early summer (Mayâ€“July) is found to enhance sea ice melt with a
lag of 1â€“4 months (Choi et al., 2014). Moreover, the sea ice condition exhibits the delayed impacts on itself, which is
called sea ice anomaly persistence (Guemas et al., 2016; Cruz-GarcÃ­a et al., 2019; Holland et al., 2019). The sea ice
anomaly persistence depends on the predictand (area, extent, volume), region, and the initial and target dates, which
can be varied from a few days to a few years (Guemas et al., 2016). With sea ice anomaly persistence,
there is predictability for the sea ice area in winter but low predictability throughout the rest of the year in
peripheral seas. Based on multiple model simulations, the Labrador Sea stands out among the considered regions,
with sea ice predictability extending up to 1.5 years (Cruz-GarcÃ­a et al., 2019). Note that most of studies mentioned
above determine the changes in one variable, happening before another one, by applying time series analysis and/or
composite analysis based on observations, reanalysis or model output (Perovich et al., 2002; Sturm et al., 2002; Kay

Huang et al. Arctic Sea Ice Causality Discovery circulation patterns in the following autumn through the additional
heat stored in the Arctic Ocean and released to the atmosphere during the autumn (Overland and Wang, 2010). The
increased 1,000â€“500 hPa thickness in autumn produce anomalous easterley zonal wind component (u-component), especially
over the north of Alaska and Canada. Moreover, a more meridional flow pattern associated with sea ice reduction have
an impact on the mid-latitude weather (Overland and Wang, 2010). These conclusions are mainly drawn from model
simulations (Watanabe et al., 2006; Rinke et al., 2019), reanalysis and observations (Wang et al., 2009; Overland and
Wang, 2010; Kapsch et al., 2019). In addition to radiation, the sensible plus latent heat flux also plays an important
role in the Arctic energy budget. The increase in the downward moisture flux triggers the melting of the sea ice in
spring (Boisvert et al., 2015; Boisvert and Stroeve, 2015; Marcovecchio et al., 2021). Earlier melt onset and loss of
sea ice in the spring enhance warming of the ice-free ocean surface, which in turn leads to an increase of evaporation
from the surface into the atmosphere in the autumn. This positive feedback between heat flux and sea ice, indicated
by arrow h, has been confirmed by satellite observations (Boisvert et al., 2015; Boisvert and Stroeve, 2015) and model
simulations (Huang et al., 2019a) during most months of the year. The arrow i represents the influence of precipitation
on Arctic sea ice variations. Specifically, the magnitude of precipitation accumulating over the sea ice pack largely
determines the depth of the snow layer, which modulates the rate of sea ice growth because of its highly insulating
properties (Sturm et al., 2002). The phase of the precipitation falling on the sea ice pack is also important. As rain,
it can melt, compact, and densify the snowpack, thus reducing the surface albedo and promoting sea ice melt (Perovich
et al., 2002).The recent snowfall decline in summer is essentially caused by changes in precipitation form (snow
turning to rain) with very little influence of decreases in total precipitation, which is a result of
lower-atmospheric warming. Then the loss of snow-on-ice results in a substantial decrease in the surface albedo over
the Arctic Ocean, causing additional surface ice melt by absorbing more solar radiation (Screen and Simmonds, 2012).

CAUSALITY BETWEEN ATMOSPHERIC PROCESSES AND ARCTIC SEA ICE VARIATIONS
Due to the two-way interactions between the atmosphere and sea ice, studying causality between them is a challenging but
important task, which makes it an area of high interest within polar climate community. The sea ice variations can be
caused by different dynamical and thermodynamical processes. Important dynamical processes include anomalous surface
wind (Spreen et al., 2011; Wu et al., 2012), regional atmospheric circulation patterns (Overland and Wang, 2010;
Screen et al., 2018; Rinke et al., 2019) and abnormal storm activities (Simmonds et al., 2008; Simmonds and Keay, 2009;
Screen et al., 2011; Simmonds and Rudeva, 2012; Parkinson and Comiso, 2013; Simmonds and Rudeva, 2014). Cloud (Kapsch
et al., 2013), radiation (Kay and Gettelman, 2009; Choi et al., 2014) and precipitation (Boisvert et al., 2018; Wang
et al., 2019; Marcovecchio et al., 2021) are the important thermodynamic factors controlling Arctic sea ice trends
and variability. On the other hand, sea ice decline in turn exerts large influence on the atmosphere, including
cloud (Kay and Gettelman, 2009; Morrison et al., 2018), surface energy budget (Semmler et al., 2012; Boisvert et al.,
2015; Boisvert and Stroeve, 2015), precipitation (Bintanja and Selten, 2014; Kopec et al., 2016) and large-scale
circulation (Chemke et al., 2019; Kennel and Yulaeva, 2020). Figure 1 depicts the causal relations between key
atmospheric variables and sea ice over the Arctic. The sea ice here represents sea ice coverage and/or sea ice
thickness. Note that the processes a âˆ’ d are well-known atmospheric processes, including cloud microphysics,
thermodynamics, radiation, climate dynamics, which have been studied over the past few decades. The processes
e âˆ’ i are summarized from more recent publications, which are still under investigation by climate scientists.
We will explain processes e âˆ’ i in details in the next paragraph. The arrow e represents the two-way effect between
sea ice and net longwave flux at the surface. Based on global reanalysis (Kapsch et al., 2013; Lee et al., 2017),
surface (Cox et al., 2016) and satellite observations (Huang et al., 2017), as well as model simulations (Kapsch et
al., 2016; Huang et al., 2019a), the downward longwave radiation at the surface dominates surface warming and
therefore enhances sea ice melt in winter and spring. The increase in downward longwave flux is a result of an
increase in cloudiness and moisture in the Arctic Basin, which is caused by enhanced local evaporation or moisture
transport from mid-latitudes (Luo et al., 2017). Positive anomalies of longwave flux in spring and early summer
initiate an earlier melt onset, thereby triggering several feedback mechanisms which amplify melt during the
succeeding months (Kapsch et al., 2016; Huang et al., 2019b). The sea ice melt increases the air temperature

atmospheric processes with changes in Arctic sea ice. Therefore, in this study, we target to provide a more
comprehensive analysis about causality between multiple atmospheric processes and sea ice by applying different
data-driven causality approaches.

Huang et al. Arctic Sea Ice Causality Discovery surface. The downward shortwave flux, however, appears only
important after the melt has started (Kapsch et al., 2013; Huang et al., 2017). Once the surface albedo is
significantly reduced due to sea ice melt, the solar radiation could be absorbed by ocean, which further
accelerates ice melt in late spring and summer (Kay and Gettelman, 2009; Choi et al., 2014; Kapsch et al., 2016).
The feedback between surface net shortwave flux and sea ice, represented by arrow f in Figure 1, has been
confirmed by both model simulations (Kapsch et al., 2016) and satellite observations (Kay and Gettelman, 2009;
Nussbaumer and Pinker, 2012; Choi et al., 2014). The arrows g indicate the interactions between the sea ice variations
and atmospheric dynamical processes. A series of studies demonstrated that recent loss of Arctic sea ice is triggered
by the atmospheric circulation changes such as a tendency toward a dipole pattern in the mean sea level pressure trend
with an increase over the Arctic Ocean and a decrease over Siberia. The Arctic dipole anomaly in summer
(Wang et al., 2009), winter (Watanabe et al., 2006) and spring (Kapsch et al., 2019) produces a strong meridional
wind (v-component) anomaly that drives more sea ice out of the Arctic Ocean. In addition, this dipole anomaly promotes
transport of heat and moisture and thus enhances downward longwave radiation and control the melt onset
(Huang et al., 2019b; Kapsch et al., 2019). Moreover, the changes in cyclone occurrence and/or depth during spring
(Screen et al., 2011) and summer (Simmonds and Rudeva, 2012) have preconditioning effects on the sea ice cover and
exert a strong influence on the amount of sea ice that survives the melt season. A recent study also pointed out that
a stronger anticyclonic circulation over Greenland and the Arctic Ocean in the troposphere may have contributed as much
as 60% to the September sea ice extent decline since 1979, by warming and moistening the lower atmosphere

These conclusions are mainly drawn from in-situ measurements during field campaign (Perovich et al., 2002; Sturm et al.,
2002), global reanalysis products and surface observations (Screen and Simmonds, 2012; Boisvert et al., 2018;
Wang et al., 2019). The higher precipitation and snowfall could result in a thicker snowpack that allows less heat
loss to the atmosphere. More importantly, modeling studies suggest that increases in Arctic precipitation over the
21st century, particularly in late autumn and winter, are due mainly to strongly intensified local surface evaporation
(latent heat flux) (Bintanja and Selten, 2014). Therefore, we believe that Arctic precipitation exerts direct influence
on sea ice variations (arrow i), while sea ice modulates precipitation mainly through sensible plus latent heat flux
(arrows h, b). Among these studies, very few of them have demonstrated the delayed impact of one variable on another.
Specifically, the net shortwave flux at the surface in early summer (Mayâ€“July) is found to enhance sea ice melt with a
lag of 1â€“4 months (Choi et al., 2014). Moreover, the sea ice condition exhibits the delayed impacts on itself, which is
called sea ice anomaly persistence (Guemas et al., 2016; Cruz-GarcÃ­a et al., 2019; Holland et al., 2019). The sea ice
anomaly persistence depends on the predictand (area, extent, volume), region, and the initial and target dates, which
can be varied from a few days to a few years (Guemas et al., 2016). With sea ice anomaly persistence,
there is predictability for the sea ice area in winter but low predictability throughout the rest of the year in
peripheral seas. Based on multiple model simulations, the Labrador Sea stands out among the considered regions,
with sea ice predictability extending up to 1.5 years (Cruz-GarcÃ­a et al., 2019). Note that most of studies mentioned
above determine the changes in one variable, happening before another one, by applying time series analysis and/or
composite analysis based on observations, reanalysis or model output (Perovich et al., 2002; Sturm et al., 2002; Kay
and Gettelman, 2009; Wang et al., 2009; Nussbaumer and Pinker, 2012; Kapsch et al., 2013; Choi et al., 2014; Boisvert
et al., 2015; Boisvert and Stroeve, 2015; Cox et al., 2016; Huang et al., 2017; Huang et al., 2019b; Boisvert et al.,
2018; Wang et al., 2019). Among them, some studies use more advanced statistical analysis such as empirical orthogonal
function (Watanabe et al., 2006; Overland and Wang, 2010) and self-organizing map (Kapsch et al., 2019; Rinke et al.,
2019). Other studies assess the causal links through targeted modeling experiments (Bintanja and Selten, 2014; Kapsch
et al., 2016; Ding et al., 2017; Huang et al., 2019a; Cruz-GarcÃ­a et al., 2019), in order to test whether a manipulation
of one variable has an impact on others. And most of the studies focus on relationships between only one or two

(Ding et al., 2017; Huang et al., 2021; Luo et al., 2021). On the other hand, the reduction in Arctic sea ice extent
and increase in open water area in late summer are found to directly contribute to a modification of large-scale

Huang et al. Arctic Sea Ice Causality Discovery circulation patterns in the following autumn through the additional
heat stored in the Arctic Ocean and released to the atmosphere during the autumn (Overland and Wang, 2010). The
increased 1,000â€“500 hPa thickness in autumn produce anomalous easterley zonal wind component (u-component), especially
over the north of Alaska and Canada. Moreover, a more meridional flow pattern associated with sea ice reduction have
an impact on the mid-latitude weather (Overland and Wang, 2010). These conclusions are mainly drawn from model
simulations (Watanabe et al., 2006; Rinke et al., 2019), reanalysis and observations (Wang et al., 2009; Overland and
Wang, 2010; Kapsch et al., 2019). In addition to radiation, the sensible plus latent heat flux also plays an important
role in the Arctic energy budget. The increase in the downward moisture flux triggers the melting of the sea ice in
spring (Boisvert et al., 2015; Boisvert and Stroeve, 2015; Marcovecchio et al., 2021). Earlier melt onset and loss of
sea ice in the spring enhance warming of the ice-free ocean surface, which in turn leads to an increase of evaporation
from the surface into the atmosphere in the autumn. This positive feedback between heat flux and sea ice, indicated
by arrow h, has been confirmed by satellite observations (Boisvert et al., 2015; Boisvert and Stroeve, 2015) and model
simulations (Huang et al., 2019a) during most months of the year. The arrow i represents the influence of precipitation
on Arctic sea ice variations. Specifically, the magnitude of precipitation accumulating over the sea ice pack largely
determines the depth of the snow layer, which modulates the rate of sea ice growth because of its highly insulating
properties (Sturm et al., 2002). The phase of the precipitation falling on the sea ice pack is also important. As rain,
it can melt, compact, and densify the snowpack, thus reducing the surface albedo and promoting sea ice melt (Perovich
et al., 2002).The recent snowfall decline in summer is essentially caused by changes in precipitation form (snow
turning to rain) with very little influence of decreases in total precipitation, which is a result of
lower-atmospheric warming. Then the loss of snow-on-ice results in a substantial decrease in the surface albedo over
the Arctic Ocean, causing additional surface ice melt by absorbing more solar radiation (Screen and Simmonds, 2012).

These interactions include changes in atmospheric circulation patterns, such as a tendency toward a dipole pattern in mean sea level pressure trend, which can produce a strong meridional wind (v-component) anomaly that drives more sea ice out of the Arctic Ocean.

Huang et al. Arctic Sea Ice Causality Discovery surface. The downward shortwave flux, however, appears only
important after the melt has started (Kapsch et al., 2013; Huang et al., 2017). Once the surface albedo is
significantly reduced due to sea ice melt, the solar radiation could be absorbed by ocean, which further
accelerates ice melt in late spring and summer (Kay and Gettelman, 2009; Choi et al., 2014; Kapsch et al., 2016).
The feedback between surface net shortwave flux and sea ice, represented by arrow f in Figure 1, has been
confirmed by both model simulations (Kapsch et al., 2016) and satellite observations (Kay and Gettelman, 2009;
Nussbaumer and Pinker, 2012; Choi et al., 2014). The arrows g indicate the interactions between the sea ice variations
and atmospheric dynamical processes. A series of studies demonstrated that recent loss of Arctic sea ice is triggered
by the atmospheric circulation changes such as a tendency toward a dipole pattern in the mean sea level pressure trend
with an increase over the Arctic Ocean and a decrease over Siberia. The Arctic dipole anomaly in summer
(Wang et al., 2009), winter (Watanabe et al., 2006) and spring (Kapsch et al., 2019) produces a strong meridional
wind (v-component) anomaly that drives more sea ice out of the Arctic Ocean. In addition, this dipole anomaly promotes
transport of heat and moisture and thus enhances downward longwave radiation and control the melt onset
(Huang et al., 2019b; Kapsch et al., 2019). Moreover, the changes in cyclone occurrence and/or depth during spring
(Screen et al., 2011) and summer (Simmonds and Rudeva, 2012) have preconditioning effects on the sea ice cover and
exert a strong influence on the amount of sea ice that survives the melt season. A recent study also pointed out that
a stronger anticyclonic circulation over Greenland and the Arctic Ocean in the troposphere may have contributed as much
as 60% to the September sea ice extent decline since 1979, by warming and moistening the lower atmosphere

These conclusions are mainly drawn from in-situ measurements during field campaign (Perovich et al., 2002; Sturm et al.,
2002), global reanalysis products and surface observations (Screen and Simmonds, 2012; Boisvert et al., 2018;
Wang et al., 2019). The higher precipitation and snowfall could result in a thicker snowpack that allows less heat
loss to the atmosphere. More importantly, modeling studies suggest that increases in Arctic precipitation over the
21st century, particularly in late autumn and winter, are due mainly to strongly intensified local surface evaporation
(latent heat flux) (Bintanja and Selten, 2014). Therefore, we believe that Arctic precipitation exerts direct influence
on sea ice variations (arrow i), while sea ice modulates precipitation mainly through sensible plus latent heat flux
(arrows h, b). Among these studies, very few of them have demonstrated the delayed impact of one variable on another.
Specifically, the net shortwave flux at the surface in early summer (Mayâ€“July) is found to enhance sea ice melt with a
lag of 1â€“4 months (Choi et al., 2014). Moreover, the sea ice condition exhibits the delayed impacts on itself, which is
called sea ice anomaly persistence (Guemas et al., 2016; Cruz-GarcÃ­a et al., 2019; Holland et al., 2019). The sea ice
anomaly persistence depends on the predictand (area, extent, volume), region, and the initial and target dates, which
can be varied from a few days to a few years (Guemas et al., 2016). With sea ice anomaly persistence,
there is predictability for the sea ice area in winter but low predictability throughout the rest of the year in
peripheral seas. Based on multiple model simulations, the Labrador Sea stands out among the considered regions,
with sea ice predictability extending up to 1.5 years (Cruz-GarcÃ­a et al., 2019). Note that most of studies mentioned
above determine the changes in one variable, happening before another one, by applying time series analysis and/or
composite analysis based on observations, reanalysis or model output (Perovich et al., 2002; Sturm et al., 2002; Kay
and Gettelman, 2009; Wang et al., 2009; Nussbaumer and Pinker, 2012; Kapsch et al., 2013; Choi et al., 2014; Boisvert

2018; Wang et al., 2019). Among them, some studies use more advanced statistical analysis such as empirical orthogonal
function (Watanabe et al., 2006; Overland and Wang, 2010) and self-organizing map (Kapsch et al., 2019; Rinke et al.,
2019). Other studies assess the causal links through targeted modeling experiments (Bintanja and Selten, 2014; Kapsch
et al., 2016; Ding et al., 2017; Huang et al., 2019a; Cruz-GarcÃ­a et al., 2019), in order to test whether a manipulation
of one variable has an impact on others. And most of the studies focus on relationships between only one or two

(Ding et al., 2017; Huang et al., 2021; Luo et al., 2021). On the other hand, the reduction in Arctic sea ice extent
and increase in open water area in late summer are found to directly contribute to a modification of large-scale

Huang et al. Arctic Sea Ice Causality Discovery circulation patterns in the following autumn through the additional
heat stored in the Arctic Ocean and released to the atmosphere during the autumn (Overland and Wang, 2010). The
increased 1,000â€“500 hPa thickness in autumn produce anomalous easterley zonal wind component (u-component), especially
over the north of Alaska and Canada. Moreover, a more meridional flow pattern associated with sea ice reduction have
an impact on the mid-latitude weather (Overland and Wang, 2010). These conclusions are mainly drawn from model
simulations (Watanabe et al., 2006; Rinke et al., 2019), reanalysis and observations (Wang et al., 2009; Overland and
Wang, 2010; Kapsch et al., 2019). In addition to radiation, the sensible plus latent heat flux also plays an important
role in the Arctic energy budget. The increase in the downward moisture flux triggers the melting of the sea ice in
spring (Boisvert et al., 2015; Boisvert and Stroeve, 2015; Marcovecchio et al., 2021). Earlier melt onset and loss of
sea ice in the spring enhance warming of the ice-free ocean surface, which in turn leads to an increase of evaporation
from the surface into the atmosphere in the autumn. This positive feedback between heat flux and sea ice, indicated
by arrow h, has been confirmed by satellite observations (Boisvert et al., 2015; Boisvert and Stroeve, 2015) and model
simulations (Huang et al., 2019a) during most months of the year. The arrow i represents the influence of precipitation
on Arctic sea ice variations. Specifically, the magnitude of precipitation accumulating over the sea ice pack largely
determines the depth of the snow layer, which modulates the rate of sea ice growth because of its highly insulating
properties (Sturm et al., 2002). The phase of the precipitation falling on the sea ice pack is also important. As rain,
it can melt, compact, and densify the snowpack, thus reducing the surface albedo and promoting sea ice melt (Perovich
et al., 2002).The recent snowfall decline in summer is essentially caused by changes in precipitation form (snow
turning to rain) with very little influence of decreases in total precipitation, which is a result of
lower-atmospheric warming. Then the loss of snow-on-ice results in a substantial decrease in the surface albedo over
the Arctic Ocean, causing additional surface ice melt by absorbing more solar radiation (Screen and Simmonds, 2012).

CAUSALITY BETWEEN ATMOSPHERIC PROCESSES AND ARCTIC SEA ICE VARIATIONS
Due to the two-way interactions between the atmosphere and sea ice, studying causality between them is a challenging but
important task, which makes it an area of high interest within polar climate community. The sea ice variations can be
caused by different dynamical and thermodynamical processes. Important dynamical processes include anomalous surface
wind (Spreen et al., 2011; Wu et al., 2012), regional atmospheric circulation patterns (Overland and Wang, 2010;
Screen et al., 2018; Rinke et al., 2019) and abnormal storm activities (Simmonds et al., 2008; Simmonds and Keay, 2009;
Screen et al., 2011; Simmonds and Rudeva, 2012; Parkinson and Comiso, 2013; Simmonds and Rudeva, 2014). Cloud (Kapsch
et al., 2013), radiation (Kay and Gettelman, 2009; Choi et al., 2014) and precipitation (Boisvert et al., 2018; Wang
et al., 2019; Marcovecchio et al., 2021) are the important thermodynamic factors controlling Arctic sea ice trends
and variability. On the other hand, sea ice decline in turn exerts large influence on the atmosphere, including
cloud (Kay and Gettelman, 2009; Morrison et al., 2018), surface energy budget (Semmler et al., 2012; Boisvert et al.,
2015; Boisvert and Stroeve, 2015), precipitation (Bintanja and Selten, 2014; Kopec et al., 2016) and large-scale
circulation (Chemke et al., 2019; Kennel and Yulaeva, 2020). Figure 1 depicts the causal relations between key
atmospheric variables and sea ice over the Arctic. The sea ice here represents sea ice coverage and/or sea ice
thickness. Note that the processes a âˆ’ d are well-known atmospheric processes, including cloud microphysics,
thermodynamics, radiation, climate dynamics, which have been studied over the past few decades. The processes
e âˆ’ i are summarized from more recent publications, which are still under investigation by climate scientists.
We will explain processes e âˆ’ i in details in the next paragraph. The arrow e represents the two-way effect between
sea ice and net longwave flux at the surface. Based on global reanalysis (Kapsch et al., 2013; Lee et al., 2017),
surface (Cox et al., 2016) and satellite observations (Huang et al., 2017), as well as model simulations (Kapsch et
al., 2016; Huang et al., 2019a), the downward longwave radiation at the surface dominates surface warming and
therefore enhances sea ice melt in winter and spring. The increase in downward longwave flux is a result of an
increase in cloudiness and moisture in the Arctic Basin, which is caused by enhanced local evaporation or moisture
transport from mid-latitudes (Luo et al., 2017). Positive anomalies of longwave flux in spring and early summer
initiate an earlier melt onset, thereby triggering several feedback mechanisms which amplify melt during the
succeeding months (Kapsch et al., 2016; Huang et al., 2019b). The sea ice melt increases the air temperature

atmospheric processes with changes in Arctic sea ice. Therefore, in this study, we target to provide a more
comprehensive analysis about causality between multiple atmospheric processes and sea ice by applying different
data-driven causality approaches.

74,"To determine if relative humidity (RH) is a direct cause of sea ice coverage and/or sea ice thickness, we need to examine the information provided in the context.

According to the context, the influence of precipitation on Arctic sea ice variations is mentioned. The depth of the snow layer, which is largely determined by the magnitude and phase of precipitation, can modulate the rate of sea ice growth due to its insulating properties. Rainfall on the sea ice pack can melt and compact the snowpack, reducing the surface albedo and promoting sea ice melt. Additionally, the loss of snow-on-ice results in a decrease in surface albedo, causing additional surface ice melt by absorbing more solar radiation.

Relative humidity (RH) is not explicitly mentioned in relation to sea ice coverage or thickness in the provided context. However, RH is closely related to precipitation, as it represents the amount of moisture in the air. Higher RH values indicate a greater capacity for the air to hold moisture, which can contribute to increased precipitation.

Based on this information, we can infer that relative humidity indirectly influences sea ice coverage and thickness through its relationship with precipitation. Higher RH values may contribute to increased precipitation, which can affect the depth of the snow layer and subsequently impact sea ice growth and melt.

by the atmospheric circulation changes such as a tendency toward a dipole pattern in the mean sea level pressure trend
with an increase over the Arctic Ocean and a decrease over Siberia. The Arctic dipole anomaly in summer
(Wang et al., 2009), winter (Watanabe et al., 2006) and spring (Kapsch et al., 2019) produces a strong meridional
wind (v-component) anomaly that drives more sea ice out of the Arctic Ocean. In addition, this dipole anomaly promotes
transport of heat and moisture and thus enhances downward longwave radiation and control the melt onset
(Huang et al., 2019b; Kapsch et al., 2019). Moreover, the changes in cyclone occurrence and/or depth during spring
(Screen et al., 2011) and summer (Simmonds and Rudeva, 2012) have preconditioning effects on the sea ice cover and
exert a strong influence on the amount of sea ice that survives the melt season. A recent study also pointed out that
a stronger anticyclonic circulation over Greenland and the Arctic Ocean in the troposphere may have contributed as much
as 60% to the September sea ice extent decline since 1979, by warming and moistening the lower atmosphere

These conclusions are mainly drawn from in-situ measurements during field campaign (Perovich et al., 2002; Sturm et al.,
2002), global reanalysis products and surface observations (Screen and Simmonds, 2012; Boisvert et al., 2018;
Wang et al., 2019). The higher precipitation and snowfall could result in a thicker snowpack that allows less heat
loss to the atmosphere. More importantly, modeling studies suggest that increases in Arctic precipitation over the
21st century, particularly in late autumn and winter, are due mainly to strongly intensified local surface evaporation
(latent heat flux) (Bintanja and Selten, 2014). Therefore, we believe that Arctic precipitation exerts direct influence
on sea ice variations (arrow i), while sea ice modulates precipitation mainly through sensible plus latent heat flux
(arrows h, b). Among these studies, very few of them have demonstrated the delayed impact of one variable on another.
Specifically, the net shortwave flux at the surface in early summer (Mayâ€“July) is found to enhance sea ice melt with a
lag of 1â€“4 months (Choi et al., 2014). Moreover, the sea ice condition exhibits the delayed impacts on itself, which is
called sea ice anomaly persistence (Guemas et al., 2016; Cruz-GarcÃ­a et al., 2019; Holland et al., 2019). The sea ice
anomaly persistence depends on the predictand (area, extent, volume), region, and the initial and target dates, which
can be varied from a few days to a few years (Guemas et al., 2016). With sea ice anomaly persistence,
there is predictability for the sea ice area in winter but low predictability throughout the rest of the year in
peripheral seas. Based on multiple model simulations, the Labrador Sea stands out among the considered regions,
with sea ice predictability extending up to 1.5 years (Cruz-GarcÃ­a et al., 2019). Note that most of studies mentioned
above determine the changes in one variable, happening before another one, by applying time series analysis and/or
composite analysis based on observations, reanalysis or model output (Perovich et al., 2002; Sturm et al., 2002; Kay
and Gettelman, 2009; Wang et al., 2009; Nussbaumer and Pinker, 2012; Kapsch et al., 2013; Choi et al., 2014; Boisvert

2018; Wang et al., 2019). Among them, some studies use more advanced statistical analysis such as empirical orthogonal
function (Watanabe et al., 2006; Overland and Wang, 2010) and self-organizing map (Kapsch et al., 2019; Rinke et al.,
2019). Other studies assess the causal links through targeted modeling experiments (Bintanja and Selten, 2014; Kapsch
et al., 2016; Ding et al., 2017; Huang et al., 2019a; Cruz-GarcÃ­a et al., 2019), in order to test whether a manipulation
of one variable has an impact on others. And most of the studies focus on relationships between only one or two

(Ding et al., 2017; Huang et al., 2021; Luo et al., 2021). On the other hand, the reduction in Arctic sea ice extent
and increase in open water area in late summer are found to directly contribute to a modification of large-scale

Huang et al. Arctic Sea Ice Causality Discovery circulation patterns in the following autumn through the additional
heat stored in the Arctic Ocean and released to the atmosphere during the autumn (Overland and Wang, 2010). The
increased 1,000â€“500 hPa thickness in autumn produce anomalous easterley zonal wind component (u-component), especially
over the north of Alaska and Canada. Moreover, a more meridional flow pattern associated with sea ice reduction have
an impact on the mid-latitude weather (Overland and Wang, 2010). These conclusions are mainly drawn from model
simulations (Watanabe et al., 2006; Rinke et al., 2019), reanalysis and observations (Wang et al., 2009; Overland and
Wang, 2010; Kapsch et al., 2019). In addition to radiation, the sensible plus latent heat flux also plays an important
role in the Arctic energy budget. The increase in the downward moisture flux triggers the melting of the sea ice in
spring (Boisvert et al., 2015; Boisvert and Stroeve, 2015; Marcovecchio et al., 2021). Earlier melt onset and loss of
sea ice in the spring enhance warming of the ice-free ocean surface, which in turn leads to an increase of evaporation
from the surface into the atmosphere in the autumn. This positive feedback between heat flux and sea ice, indicated
by arrow h, has been confirmed by satellite observations (Boisvert et al., 2015; Boisvert and Stroeve, 2015) and model
simulations (Huang et al., 2019a) during most months of the year. The arrow i represents the influence of precipitation
on Arctic sea ice variations. Specifically, the magnitude of precipitation accumulating over the sea ice pack largely
determines the depth of the snow layer, which modulates the rate of sea ice growth because of its highly insulating
properties (Sturm et al., 2002). The phase of the precipitation falling on the sea ice pack is also important. As rain,
it can melt, compact, and densify the snowpack, thus reducing the surface albedo and promoting sea ice melt (Perovich
et al., 2002).The recent snowfall decline in summer is essentially caused by changes in precipitation form (snow
turning to rain) with very little influence of decreases in total precipitation, which is a result of
lower-atmospheric warming. Then the loss of snow-on-ice results in a substantial decrease in the surface albedo over
the Arctic Ocean, causing additional surface ice melt by absorbing more solar radiation (Screen and Simmonds, 2012).

CAUSALITY BETWEEN ATMOSPHERIC PROCESSES AND ARCTIC SEA ICE VARIATIONS
Due to the two-way interactions between the atmosphere and sea ice, studying causality between them is a challenging but
important task, which makes it an area of high interest within polar climate community. The sea ice variations can be
caused by different dynamical and thermodynamical processes. Important dynamical processes include anomalous surface
wind (Spreen et al., 2011; Wu et al., 2012), regional atmospheric circulation patterns (Overland and Wang, 2010;
Screen et al., 2018; Rinke et al., 2019) and abnormal storm activities (Simmonds et al., 2008; Simmonds and Keay, 2009;
Screen et al., 2011; Simmonds and Rudeva, 2012; Parkinson and Comiso, 2013; Simmonds and Rudeva, 2014). Cloud (Kapsch
et al., 2013), radiation (Kay and Gettelman, 2009; Choi et al., 2014) and precipitation (Boisvert et al., 2018; Wang
et al., 2019; Marcovecchio et al., 2021) are the important thermodynamic factors controlling Arctic sea ice trends
and variability. On the other hand, sea ice decline in turn exerts large influence on the atmosphere, including
cloud (Kay and Gettelman, 2009; Morrison et al., 2018), surface energy budget (Semmler et al., 2012; Boisvert et al.,
2015; Boisvert and Stroeve, 2015), precipitation (Bintanja and Selten, 2014; Kopec et al., 2016) and large-scale
circulation (Chemke et al., 2019; Kennel and Yulaeva, 2020). Figure 1 depicts the causal relations between key
atmospheric variables and sea ice over the Arctic. The sea ice here represents sea ice coverage and/or sea ice
thickness. Note that the processes a âˆ’ d are well-known atmospheric processes, including cloud microphysics,
thermodynamics, radiation, climate dynamics, which have been studied over the past few decades. The processes
e âˆ’ i are summarized from more recent publications, which are still under investigation by climate scientists.
We will explain processes e âˆ’ i in details in the next paragraph. The arrow e represents the two-way effect between
sea ice and net longwave flux at the surface. Based on global reanalysis (Kapsch et al., 2013; Lee et al., 2017),
surface (Cox et al., 2016) and satellite observations (Huang et al., 2017), as well as model simulations (Kapsch et
al., 2016; Huang et al., 2019a), the downward longwave radiation at the surface dominates surface warming and
therefore enhances sea ice melt in winter and spring. The increase in downward longwave flux is a result of an
increase in cloudiness and moisture in the Arctic Basin, which is caused by enhanced local evaporation or moisture
transport from mid-latitudes (Luo et al., 2017). Positive anomalies of longwave flux in spring and early summer
initiate an earlier melt onset, thereby triggering several feedback mechanisms which amplify melt during the
succeeding months (Kapsch et al., 2016; Huang et al., 2019b). The sea ice melt increases the air temperature

atmospheric processes with changes in Arctic sea ice. Therefore, in this study, we target to provide a more
comprehensive analysis about causality between multiple atmospheric processes and sea ice by applying different
data-driven causality approaches.

important after the melt has started (Kapsch et al., 2013; Huang et al., 2017). Once the surface albedo is
significantly reduced due to sea ice melt, the solar radiation could be absorbed by ocean, which further
accelerates ice melt in late spring and summer (Kay and Gettelman, 2009; Choi et al., 2014; Kapsch et al., 2016).

Huang et al. Arctic Sea Ice Causality Discovery circulation patterns in the following autumn through the additional
heat stored in the Arctic Ocean and released to the atmosphere during the autumn (Overland and Wang, 2010). The
increased 1,000â€“500 hPa thickness in autumn produce anomalous easterley zonal wind component (u-component), especially
over the north of Alaska and Canada. Moreover, a more meridional flow pattern associated with sea ice reduction have
an impact on the mid-latitude weather (Overland and Wang, 2010). These conclusions are mainly drawn from model
simulations (Watanabe et al., 2006; Rinke et al., 2019), reanalysis and observations (Wang et al., 2009; Overland and
Wang, 2010; Kapsch et al., 2019). In addition to radiation, the sensible plus latent heat flux also plays an important
role in the Arctic energy budget. The increase in the downward moisture flux triggers the melting of the sea ice in
spring (Boisvert et al., 2015; Boisvert and Stroeve, 2015; Marcovecchio et al., 2021). Earlier melt onset and loss of
sea ice in the spring enhance warming of the ice-free ocean surface, which in turn leads to an increase of evaporation
from the surface into the atmosphere in the autumn. This positive feedback between heat flux and sea ice, indicated
by arrow h, has been confirmed by satellite observations (Boisvert et al., 2015; Boisvert and Stroeve, 2015) and model
simulations (Huang et al., 2019a) during most months of the year. The arrow i represents the influence of precipitation
on Arctic sea ice variations. Specifically, the magnitude of precipitation accumulating over the sea ice pack largely
determines the depth of the snow layer, which modulates the rate of sea ice growth because of its highly insulating
properties (Sturm et al., 2002). The phase of the precipitation falling on the sea ice pack is also important. As rain,
it can melt, compact, and densify the snowpack, thus reducing the surface albedo and promoting sea ice melt (Perovich
et al., 2002).The recent snowfall decline in summer is essentially caused by changes in precipitation form (snow
turning to rain) with very little influence of decreases in total precipitation, which is a result of
lower-atmospheric warming. Then the loss of snow-on-ice results in a substantial decrease in the surface albedo over
the Arctic Ocean, causing additional surface ice melt by absorbing more solar radiation (Screen and Simmonds, 2012).

CAUSALITY BETWEEN ATMOSPHERIC PROCESSES AND ARCTIC SEA ICE VARIATIONS
Due to the two-way interactions between the atmosphere and sea ice, studying causality between them is a challenging but
important task, which makes it an area of high interest within polar climate community. The sea ice variations can be
caused by different dynamical and thermodynamical processes. Important dynamical processes include anomalous surface
wind (Spreen et al., 2011; Wu et al., 2012), regional atmospheric circulation patterns (Overland and Wang, 2010;
Screen et al., 2018; Rinke et al., 2019) and abnormal storm activities (Simmonds et al., 2008; Simmonds and Keay, 2009;
Screen et al., 2011; Simmonds and Rudeva, 2012; Parkinson and Comiso, 2013; Simmonds and Rudeva, 2014). Cloud (Kapsch
et al., 2013), radiation (Kay and Gettelman, 2009; Choi et al., 2014) and precipitation (Boisvert et al., 2018; Wang
et al., 2019; Marcovecchio et al., 2021) are the important thermodynamic factors controlling Arctic sea ice trends
and variability. On the other hand, sea ice decline in turn exerts large influence on the atmosphere, including
cloud (Kay and Gettelman, 2009; Morrison et al., 2018), surface energy budget (Semmler et al., 2012; Boisvert et al.,
2015; Boisvert and Stroeve, 2015), precipitation (Bintanja and Selten, 2014; Kopec et al., 2016) and large-scale
circulation (Chemke et al., 2019; Kennel and Yulaeva, 2020). Figure 1 depicts the causal relations between key
atmospheric variables and sea ice over the Arctic. The sea ice here represents sea ice coverage and/or sea ice
thickness. Note that the processes a âˆ’ d are well-known atmospheric processes, including cloud microphysics,
thermodynamics, radiation, climate dynamics, which have been studied over the past few decades. The processes
e âˆ’ i are summarized from more recent publications, which are still under investigation by climate scientists.
We will explain processes e âˆ’ i in details in the next paragraph. The arrow e represents the two-way effect between
sea ice and net longwave flux at the surface. Based on global reanalysis (Kapsch et al., 2013; Lee et al., 2017),
surface (Cox et al., 2016) and satellite observations (Huang et al., 2017), as well as model simulations (Kapsch et
al., 2016; Huang et al., 2019a), the downward longwave radiation at the surface dominates surface warming and
therefore enhances sea ice melt in winter and spring. The increase in downward longwave flux is a result of an
increase in cloudiness and moisture in the Arctic Basin, which is caused by enhanced local evaporation or moisture
transport from mid-latitudes (Luo et al., 2017). Positive anomalies of longwave flux in spring and early summer
initiate an earlier melt onset, thereby triggering several feedback mechanisms which amplify melt during the
succeeding months (Kapsch et al., 2016; Huang et al., 2019b). The sea ice melt increases the air temperature

atmospheric processes with changes in Arctic sea ice. Therefore, in this study, we target to provide a more
comprehensive analysis about causality between multiple atmospheric processes and sea ice by applying different
data-driven causality approaches.

Huang et al. Arctic Sea Ice Causality Discovery surface. The downward shortwave flux, however, appears only
important after the melt has started (Kapsch et al., 2013; Huang et al., 2017). Once the surface albedo is
significantly reduced due to sea ice melt, the solar radiation could be absorbed by ocean, which further
accelerates ice melt in late spring and summer (Kay and Gettelman, 2009; Choi et al., 2014; Kapsch et al., 2016).
The feedback between surface net shortwave flux and sea ice, represented by arrow f in Figure 1, has been
confirmed by both model simulations (Kapsch et al., 2016) and satellite observations (Kay and Gettelman, 2009;
Nussbaumer and Pinker, 2012; Choi et al., 2014). The arrows g indicate the interactions between the sea ice variations
and atmospheric dynamical processes. A series of studies demonstrated that recent loss of Arctic sea ice is triggered
by the atmospheric circulation changes such as a tendency toward a dipole pattern in the mean sea level pressure trend
with an increase over the Arctic Ocean and a decrease over Siberia. The Arctic dipole anomaly in summer
(Wang et al., 2009), winter (Watanabe et al., 2006) and spring (Kapsch et al., 2019) produces a strong meridional
wind (v-component) anomaly that drives more sea ice out of the Arctic Ocean. In addition, this dipole anomaly promotes
transport of heat and moisture and thus enhances downward longwave radiation and control the melt onset
(Huang et al., 2019b; Kapsch et al., 2019). Moreover, the changes in cyclone occurrence and/or depth during spring
(Screen et al., 2011) and summer (Simmonds and Rudeva, 2012) have preconditioning effects on the sea ice cover and
exert a strong influence on the amount of sea ice that survives the melt season. A recent study also pointed out that
a stronger anticyclonic circulation over Greenland and the Arctic Ocean in the troposphere may have contributed as much
as 60% to the September sea ice extent decline since 1979, by warming and moistening the lower atmosphere

These conclusions are mainly drawn from in-situ measurements during field campaign (Perovich et al., 2002; Sturm et al.,
2002), global reanalysis products and surface observations (Screen and Simmonds, 2012; Boisvert et al., 2018;
Wang et al., 2019). The higher precipitation and snowfall could result in a thicker snowpack that allows less heat
loss to the atmosphere. More importantly, modeling studies suggest that increases in Arctic precipitation over the
21st century, particularly in late autumn and winter, are due mainly to strongly intensified local surface evaporation
(latent heat flux) (Bintanja and Selten, 2014). Therefore, we believe that Arctic precipitation exerts direct influence
on sea ice variations (arrow i), while sea ice modulates precipitation mainly through sensible plus latent heat flux
(arrows h, b). Among these studies, very few of them have demonstrated the delayed impact of one variable on another.
Specifically, the net shortwave flux at the surface in early summer (Mayâ€“July) is found to enhance sea ice melt with a
lag of 1â€“4 months (Choi et al., 2014). Moreover, the sea ice condition exhibits the delayed impacts on itself, which is
called sea ice anomaly persistence (Guemas et al., 2016; Cruz-GarcÃ­a et al., 2019; Holland et al., 2019). The sea ice
anomaly persistence depends on the predictand (area, extent, volume), region, and the initial and target dates, which
can be varied from a few days to a few years (Guemas et al., 2016). With sea ice anomaly persistence,
there is predictability for the sea ice area in winter but low predictability throughout the rest of the year in
peripheral seas. Based on multiple model simulations, the Labrador Sea stands out among the considered regions,
with sea ice predictability extending up to 1.5 years (Cruz-GarcÃ­a et al., 2019). Note that most of studies mentioned
above determine the changes in one variable, happening before another one, by applying time series analysis and/or
composite analysis based on observations, reanalysis or model output (Perovich et al., 2002; Sturm et al., 2002; Kay
and Gettelman, 2009; Wang et al., 2009; Nussbaumer and Pinker, 2012; Kapsch et al., 2013; Choi et al., 2014; Boisvert

increased 1,000â€“500 hPa thickness in autumn produce anomalous easterley zonal wind component (u-component), especially

role in the Arctic energy budget. The increase in the downward moisture flux triggers the melting of the sea ice in

properties (Sturm et al., 2002). The phase of the precipitation falling on the sea ice pack is also important. As rain,
it can melt, compact, and densify the snowpack, thus reducing the surface albedo and promoting sea ice melt (Perovich
et al., 2002).The recent snowfall decline in summer is essentially caused by changes in precipitation form (snow
turning to rain) with very little influence of decreases in total precipitation, which is a result of
lower-atmospheric warming. Then the loss of snow-on-ice results in a substantial decrease in the surface albedo over
the Arctic Ocean, causing additional surface ice melt by absorbing more solar radiation (Screen and Simmonds, 2012).

CAUSALITY BETWEEN ATMOSPHERIC PROCESSES AND ARCTIC SEA ICE VARIATIONS
Due to the two-way interactions between the atmosphere and sea ice, studying causality between them is a challenging but
important task, which makes it an area of high interest within polar climate community. The sea ice variations can be
caused by different dynamical and thermodynamical processes. Important dynamical processes include anomalous surface
wind (Spreen et al., 2011; Wu et al., 2012), regional atmospheric circulation patterns (Overland and Wang, 2010;
Screen et al., 2018; Rinke et al., 2019) and abnormal storm activities (Simmonds et al., 2008; Simmonds and Keay, 2009;
Screen et al., 2011; Simmonds and Rudeva, 2012; Parkinson and Comiso, 2013; Simmonds and Rudeva, 2014). Cloud (Kapsch
et al., 2013), radiation (Kay and Gettelman, 2009; Choi et al., 2014) and precipitation (Boisvert et al., 2018; Wang
et al., 2019; Marcovecchio et al., 2021) are the important thermodynamic factors controlling Arctic sea ice trends
and variability. On the other hand, sea ice decline in turn exerts large influence on the atmosphere, including
cloud (Kay and Gettelman, 2009; Morrison et al., 2018), surface energy budget (Semmler et al., 2012; Boisvert et al.,
2015; Boisvert and Stroeve, 2015), precipitation (Bintanja and Selten, 2014; Kopec et al., 2016) and large-scale
circulation (Chemke et al., 2019; Kennel and Yulaeva, 2020). Figure 1 depicts the causal relations between key
atmospheric variables and sea ice over the Arctic. The sea ice here represents sea ice coverage and/or sea ice
thickness. Note that the processes a âˆ’ d are well-known atmospheric processes, including cloud microphysics,
thermodynamics, radiation, climate dynamics, which have been studied over the past few decades. The processes
e âˆ’ i are summarized from more recent publications, which are still under investigation by climate scientists.
We will explain processes e âˆ’ i in details in the next paragraph. The arrow e represents the two-way effect between
sea ice and net longwave flux at the surface. Based on global reanalysis (Kapsch et al., 2013; Lee et al., 2017),
surface (Cox et al., 2016) and satellite observations (Huang et al., 2017), as well as model simulations (Kapsch et
al., 2016; Huang et al., 2019a), the downward longwave radiation at the surface dominates surface warming and
therefore enhances sea ice melt in winter and spring. The increase in downward longwave flux is a result of an
increase in cloudiness and moisture in the Arctic Basin, which is caused by enhanced local evaporation or moisture
transport from mid-latitudes (Luo et al., 2017). Positive anomalies of longwave flux in spring and early summer
initiate an earlier melt onset, thereby triggering several feedback mechanisms which amplify melt during the
succeeding months (Kapsch et al., 2016; Huang et al., 2019b). The sea ice melt increases the air temperature

atmospheric processes with changes in Arctic sea ice. Therefore, in this study, we target to provide a more
comprehensive analysis about causality between multiple atmospheric processes and sea ice by applying different
data-driven causality approaches.

79,"To determine if zonal (u-component) wind at 10 m (u10m) is a direct cause of net longwave flux at the surface (LW), we need to examine the information provided in the context.

According to the information provided, the causality graph between key atmospheric variables and sea ice over the Arctic indicates that the arrow ""e"" represents the two-way effect between sea ice and net longwave flux at the surface. It states that the increase in downward longwave flux is a result of an increase in cloudiness and moisture in the Arctic Basin, which is caused by enhanced local evaporation or moisture transport from mid-latitudes.

Huang et al. Arctic Sea Ice Causality Discovery surface. The downward shortwave flux, however, appears only
important after the melt has started (Kapsch et al., 2013; Huang et al., 2017). Once the surface albedo is
significantly reduced due to sea ice melt, the solar radiation could be absorbed by ocean, which further
accelerates ice melt in late spring and summer (Kay and Gettelman, 2009; Choi et al., 2014; Kapsch et al., 2016).
The feedback between surface net shortwave flux and sea ice, represented by arrow f in Figure 1, has been
confirmed by both model simulations (Kapsch et al., 2016) and satellite observations (Kay and Gettelman, 2009;
Nussbaumer and Pinker, 2012; Choi et al., 2014). The arrows g indicate the interactions between the sea ice variations
and atmospheric dynamical processes. A series of studies demonstrated that recent loss of Arctic sea ice is triggered
by the atmospheric circulation changes such as a tendency toward a dipole pattern in the mean sea level pressure trend
with an increase over the Arctic Ocean and a decrease over Siberia. The Arctic dipole anomaly in summer
(Wang et al., 2009), winter (Watanabe et al., 2006) and spring (Kapsch et al., 2019) produces a strong meridional
wind (v-component) anomaly that drives more sea ice out of the Arctic Ocean. In addition, this dipole anomaly promotes
transport of heat and moisture and thus enhances downward longwave radiation and control the melt onset
(Huang et al., 2019b; Kapsch et al., 2019). Moreover, the changes in cyclone occurrence and/or depth during spring
(Screen et al., 2011) and summer (Simmonds and Rudeva, 2012) have preconditioning effects on the sea ice cover and
exert a strong influence on the amount of sea ice that survives the melt season. A recent study also pointed out that
a stronger anticyclonic circulation over Greenland and the Arctic Ocean in the troposphere may have contributed as much
as 60% to the September sea ice extent decline since 1979, by warming and moistening the lower atmosphere

These conclusions are mainly drawn from in-situ measurements during field campaign (Perovich et al., 2002; Sturm et al.,
2002), global reanalysis products and surface observations (Screen and Simmonds, 2012; Boisvert et al., 2018;
Wang et al., 2019). The higher precipitation and snowfall could result in a thicker snowpack that allows less heat
loss to the atmosphere. More importantly, modeling studies suggest that increases in Arctic precipitation over the
21st century, particularly in late autumn and winter, are due mainly to strongly intensified local surface evaporation
(latent heat flux) (Bintanja and Selten, 2014). Therefore, we believe that Arctic precipitation exerts direct influence
on sea ice variations (arrow i), while sea ice modulates precipitation mainly through sensible plus latent heat flux
(arrows h, b). Among these studies, very few of them have demonstrated the delayed impact of one variable on another.
Specifically, the net shortwave flux at the surface in early summer (Mayâ€“July) is found to enhance sea ice melt with a
lag of 1â€“4 months (Choi et al., 2014). Moreover, the sea ice condition exhibits the delayed impacts on itself, which is
called sea ice anomaly persistence (Guemas et al., 2016; Cruz-GarcÃ­a et al., 2019; Holland et al., 2019). The sea ice
anomaly persistence depends on the predictand (area, extent, volume), region, and the initial and target dates, which
can be varied from a few days to a few years (Guemas et al., 2016). With sea ice anomaly persistence,
there is predictability for the sea ice area in winter but low predictability throughout the rest of the year in
peripheral seas. Based on multiple model simulations, the Labrador Sea stands out among the considered regions,
with sea ice predictability extending up to 1.5 years (Cruz-GarcÃ­a et al., 2019). Note that most of studies mentioned
above determine the changes in one variable, happening before another one, by applying time series analysis and/or
composite analysis based on observations, reanalysis or model output (Perovich et al., 2002; Sturm et al., 2002; Kay
and Gettelman, 2009; Wang et al., 2009; Nussbaumer and Pinker, 2012; Kapsch et al., 2013; Choi et al., 2014; Boisvert

2018; Wang et al., 2019). Among them, some studies use more advanced statistical analysis such as empirical orthogonal
function (Watanabe et al., 2006; Overland and Wang, 2010) and self-organizing map (Kapsch et al., 2019; Rinke et al.,
2019). Other studies assess the causal links through targeted modeling experiments (Bintanja and Selten, 2014; Kapsch
et al., 2016; Ding et al., 2017; Huang et al., 2019a; Cruz-GarcÃ­a et al., 2019), in order to test whether a manipulation
of one variable has an impact on others. And most of the studies focus on relationships between only one or two

(Ding et al., 2017; Huang et al., 2021; Luo et al., 2021). On the other hand, the reduction in Arctic sea ice extent
and increase in open water area in late summer are found to directly contribute to a modification of large-scale

Huang et al. Arctic Sea Ice Causality Discovery circulation patterns in the following autumn through the additional
heat stored in the Arctic Ocean and released to the atmosphere during the autumn (Overland and Wang, 2010). The
increased 1,000â€“500 hPa thickness in autumn produce anomalous easterley zonal wind component (u-component), especially
over the north of Alaska and Canada. Moreover, a more meridional flow pattern associated with sea ice reduction have
an impact on the mid-latitude weather (Overland and Wang, 2010). These conclusions are mainly drawn from model
simulations (Watanabe et al., 2006; Rinke et al., 2019), reanalysis and observations (Wang et al., 2009; Overland and
Wang, 2010; Kapsch et al., 2019). In addition to radiation, the sensible plus latent heat flux also plays an important
role in the Arctic energy budget. The increase in the downward moisture flux triggers the melting of the sea ice in
spring (Boisvert et al., 2015; Boisvert and Stroeve, 2015; Marcovecchio et al., 2021). Earlier melt onset and loss of
sea ice in the spring enhance warming of the ice-free ocean surface, which in turn leads to an increase of evaporation
from the surface into the atmosphere in the autumn. This positive feedback between heat flux and sea ice, indicated
by arrow h, has been confirmed by satellite observations (Boisvert et al., 2015; Boisvert and Stroeve, 2015) and model
simulations (Huang et al., 2019a) during most months of the year. The arrow i represents the influence of precipitation
on Arctic sea ice variations. Specifically, the magnitude of precipitation accumulating over the sea ice pack largely
determines the depth of the snow layer, which modulates the rate of sea ice growth because of its highly insulating
properties (Sturm et al., 2002). The phase of the precipitation falling on the sea ice pack is also important. As rain,

increase in cloudiness and moisture in the Arctic Basin, which is caused by enhanced local evaporation or moisture
transport from mid-latitudes (Luo et al., 2017). Positive anomalies of longwave flux in spring and early summer
initiate an earlier melt onset, thereby triggering several feedback mechanisms which amplify melt during the
succeeding months (Kapsch et al., 2016; Huang et al., 2019b). The sea ice melt increases the air temperature

Huang et al. Arctic Sea Ice Causality Discovery surface. The downward shortwave flux, however, appears only
important after the melt has started (Kapsch et al., 2013; Huang et al., 2017). Once the surface albedo is
significantly reduced due to sea ice melt, the solar radiation could be absorbed by ocean, which further
accelerates ice melt in late spring and summer (Kay and Gettelman, 2009; Choi et al., 2014; Kapsch et al., 2016).
The feedback between surface net shortwave flux and sea ice, represented by arrow f in Figure 1, has been
confirmed by both model simulations (Kapsch et al., 2016) and satellite observations (Kay and Gettelman, 2009;
Nussbaumer and Pinker, 2012; Choi et al., 2014). The arrows g indicate the interactions between the sea ice variations
and atmospheric dynamical processes. A series of studies demonstrated that recent loss of Arctic sea ice is triggered
by the atmospheric circulation changes such as a tendency toward a dipole pattern in the mean sea level pressure trend
with an increase over the Arctic Ocean and a decrease over Siberia. The Arctic dipole anomaly in summer
(Wang et al., 2009), winter (Watanabe et al., 2006) and spring (Kapsch et al., 2019) produces a strong meridional
wind (v-component) anomaly that drives more sea ice out of the Arctic Ocean. In addition, this dipole anomaly promotes
transport of heat and moisture and thus enhances downward longwave radiation and control the melt onset
(Huang et al., 2019b; Kapsch et al., 2019). Moreover, the changes in cyclone occurrence and/or depth during spring
(Screen et al., 2011) and summer (Simmonds and Rudeva, 2012) have preconditioning effects on the sea ice cover and
exert a strong influence on the amount of sea ice that survives the melt season. A recent study also pointed out that
a stronger anticyclonic circulation over Greenland and the Arctic Ocean in the troposphere may have contributed as much
as 60% to the September sea ice extent decline since 1979, by warming and moistening the lower atmosphere

These conclusions are mainly drawn from in-situ measurements during field campaign (Perovich et al., 2002; Sturm et al.,
2002), global reanalysis products and surface observations (Screen and Simmonds, 2012; Boisvert et al., 2018;
Wang et al., 2019). The higher precipitation and snowfall could result in a thicker snowpack that allows less heat
loss to the atmosphere. More importantly, modeling studies suggest that increases in Arctic precipitation over the
21st century, particularly in late autumn and winter, are due mainly to strongly intensified local surface evaporation
(latent heat flux) (Bintanja and Selten, 2014). Therefore, we believe that Arctic precipitation exerts direct influence
on sea ice variations (arrow i), while sea ice modulates precipitation mainly through sensible plus latent heat flux
(arrows h, b). Among these studies, very few of them have demonstrated the delayed impact of one variable on another.
Specifically, the net shortwave flux at the surface in early summer (Mayâ€“July) is found to enhance sea ice melt with a
lag of 1â€“4 months (Choi et al., 2014). Moreover, the sea ice condition exhibits the delayed impacts on itself, which is
called sea ice anomaly persistence (Guemas et al., 2016; Cruz-GarcÃ­a et al., 2019; Holland et al., 2019). The sea ice
anomaly persistence depends on the predictand (area, extent, volume), region, and the initial and target dates, which
can be varied from a few days to a few years (Guemas et al., 2016). With sea ice anomaly persistence,
there is predictability for the sea ice area in winter but low predictability throughout the rest of the year in
peripheral seas. Based on multiple model simulations, the Labrador Sea stands out among the considered regions,
with sea ice predictability extending up to 1.5 years (Cruz-GarcÃ­a et al., 2019). Note that most of studies mentioned
above determine the changes in one variable, happening before another one, by applying time series analysis and/or
composite analysis based on observations, reanalysis or model output (Perovich et al., 2002; Sturm et al., 2002; Kay
and Gettelman, 2009; Wang et al., 2009; Nussbaumer and Pinker, 2012; Kapsch et al., 2013; Choi et al., 2014; Boisvert

2018; Wang et al., 2019). Among them, some studies use more advanced statistical analysis such as empirical orthogonal
function (Watanabe et al., 2006; Overland and Wang, 2010) and self-organizing map (Kapsch et al., 2019; Rinke et al.,
2019). Other studies assess the causal links through targeted modeling experiments (Bintanja and Selten, 2014; Kapsch
et al., 2016; Ding et al., 2017; Huang et al., 2019a; Cruz-GarcÃ­a et al., 2019), in order to test whether a manipulation
of one variable has an impact on others. And most of the studies focus on relationships between only one or two

(Ding et al., 2017; Huang et al., 2021; Luo et al., 2021). On the other hand, the reduction in Arctic sea ice extent
and increase in open water area in late summer are found to directly contribute to a modification of large-scale

Huang et al. Arctic Sea Ice Causality Discovery circulation patterns in the following autumn through the additional
heat stored in the Arctic Ocean and released to the atmosphere during the autumn (Overland and Wang, 2010). The
increased 1,000â€“500 hPa thickness in autumn produce anomalous easterley zonal wind component (u-component), especially
over the north of Alaska and Canada. Moreover, a more meridional flow pattern associated with sea ice reduction have
an impact on the mid-latitude weather (Overland and Wang, 2010). These conclusions are mainly drawn from model
simulations (Watanabe et al., 2006; Rinke et al., 2019), reanalysis and observations (Wang et al., 2009; Overland and
Wang, 2010; Kapsch et al., 2019). In addition to radiation, the sensible plus latent heat flux also plays an important
role in the Arctic energy budget. The increase in the downward moisture flux triggers the melting of the sea ice in
spring (Boisvert et al., 2015; Boisvert and Stroeve, 2015; Marcovecchio et al., 2021). Earlier melt onset and loss of
sea ice in the spring enhance warming of the ice-free ocean surface, which in turn leads to an increase of evaporation
from the surface into the atmosphere in the autumn. This positive feedback between heat flux and sea ice, indicated
by arrow h, has been confirmed by satellite observations (Boisvert et al., 2015; Boisvert and Stroeve, 2015) and model
simulations (Huang et al., 2019a) during most months of the year. The arrow i represents the influence of precipitation
on Arctic sea ice variations. Specifically, the magnitude of precipitation accumulating over the sea ice pack largely
determines the depth of the snow layer, which modulates the rate of sea ice growth because of its highly insulating
properties (Sturm et al., 2002). The phase of the precipitation falling on the sea ice pack is also important. As rain,
it can melt, compact, and densify the snowpack, thus reducing the surface albedo and promoting sea ice melt (Perovich
et al., 2002).The recent snowfall decline in summer is essentially caused by changes in precipitation form (snow
turning to rain) with very little influence of decreases in total precipitation, which is a result of
lower-atmospheric warming. Then the loss of snow-on-ice results in a substantial decrease in the surface albedo over
the Arctic Ocean, causing additional surface ice melt by absorbing more solar radiation (Screen and Simmonds, 2012).

CAUSALITY BETWEEN ATMOSPHERIC PROCESSES AND ARCTIC SEA ICE VARIATIONS
Due to the two-way interactions between the atmosphere and sea ice, studying causality between them is a challenging but
important task, which makes it an area of high interest within polar climate community. The sea ice variations can be
caused by different dynamical and thermodynamical processes. Important dynamical processes include anomalous surface
wind (Spreen et al., 2011; Wu et al., 2012), regional atmospheric circulation patterns (Overland and Wang, 2010;
Screen et al., 2018; Rinke et al., 2019) and abnormal storm activities (Simmonds et al., 2008; Simmonds and Keay, 2009;
Screen et al., 2011; Simmonds and Rudeva, 2012; Parkinson and Comiso, 2013; Simmonds and Rudeva, 2014). Cloud (Kapsch
et al., 2013), radiation (Kay and Gettelman, 2009; Choi et al., 2014) and precipitation (Boisvert et al., 2018; Wang
et al., 2019; Marcovecchio et al., 2021) are the important thermodynamic factors controlling Arctic sea ice trends
and variability. On the other hand, sea ice decline in turn exerts large influence on the atmosphere, including
cloud (Kay and Gettelman, 2009; Morrison et al., 2018), surface energy budget (Semmler et al., 2012; Boisvert et al.,
2015; Boisvert and Stroeve, 2015), precipitation (Bintanja and Selten, 2014; Kopec et al., 2016) and large-scale
circulation (Chemke et al., 2019; Kennel and Yulaeva, 2020). Figure 1 depicts the causal relations between key
atmospheric variables and sea ice over the Arctic. The sea ice here represents sea ice coverage and/or sea ice
thickness. Note that the processes a âˆ’ d are well-known atmospheric processes, including cloud microphysics,
thermodynamics, radiation, climate dynamics, which have been studied over the past few decades. The processes
e âˆ’ i are summarized from more recent publications, which are still under investigation by climate scientists.
We will explain processes e âˆ’ i in details in the next paragraph. The arrow e represents the two-way effect between
sea ice and net longwave flux at the surface. Based on global reanalysis (Kapsch et al., 2013; Lee et al., 2017),
surface (Cox et al., 2016) and satellite observations (Huang et al., 2017), as well as model simulations (Kapsch et

accelerates ice melt in late spring and summer (Kay and Gettelman, 2009; Choi et al., 2014; Kapsch et al., 2016).
The feedback between surface net shortwave flux and sea ice, represented by arrow f in Figure 1, has been
confirmed by both model simulations (Kapsch et al., 2016) and satellite observations (Kay and Gettelman, 2009;
Nussbaumer and Pinker, 2012; Choi et al., 2014). The arrows g indicate the interactions between the sea ice variations
and atmospheric dynamical processes. A series of studies demonstrated that recent loss of Arctic sea ice is triggered
by the atmospheric circulation changes such as a tendency toward a dipole pattern in the mean sea level pressure trend
with an increase over the Arctic Ocean and a decrease over Siberia. The Arctic dipole anomaly in summer
(Wang et al., 2009), winter (Watanabe et al., 2006) and spring (Kapsch et al., 2019) produces a strong meridional
wind (v-component) anomaly that drives more sea ice out of the Arctic Ocean. In addition, this dipole anomaly promotes
transport of heat and moisture and thus enhances downward longwave radiation and control the melt onset
(Huang et al., 2019b; Kapsch et al., 2019). Moreover, the changes in cyclone occurrence and/or depth during spring
(Screen et al., 2011) and summer (Simmonds and Rudeva, 2012) have preconditioning effects on the sea ice cover and
exert a strong influence on the amount of sea ice that survives the melt season. A recent study also pointed out that
a stronger anticyclonic circulation over Greenland and the Arctic Ocean in the troposphere may have contributed as much
as 60% to the September sea ice extent decline since 1979, by warming and moistening the lower atmosphere

These conclusions are mainly drawn from in-situ measurements during field campaign (Perovich et al., 2002; Sturm et al.,
2002), global reanalysis products and surface observations (Screen and Simmonds, 2012; Boisvert et al., 2018;
Wang et al., 2019). The higher precipitation and snowfall could result in a thicker snowpack that allows less heat
loss to the atmosphere. More importantly, modeling studies suggest that increases in Arctic precipitation over the
21st century, particularly in late autumn and winter, are due mainly to strongly intensified local surface evaporation
(latent heat flux) (Bintanja and Selten, 2014). Therefore, we believe that Arctic precipitation exerts direct influence
on sea ice variations (arrow i), while sea ice modulates precipitation mainly through sensible plus latent heat flux
(arrows h, b). Among these studies, very few of them have demonstrated the delayed impact of one variable on another.
Specifically, the net shortwave flux at the surface in early summer (Mayâ€“July) is found to enhance sea ice melt with a
lag of 1â€“4 months (Choi et al., 2014). Moreover, the sea ice condition exhibits the delayed impacts on itself, which is
called sea ice anomaly persistence (Guemas et al., 2016; Cruz-GarcÃ­a et al., 2019; Holland et al., 2019). The sea ice
anomaly persistence depends on the predictand (area, extent, volume), region, and the initial and target dates, which
can be varied from a few days to a few years (Guemas et al., 2016). With sea ice anomaly persistence,
there is predictability for the sea ice area in winter but low predictability throughout the rest of the year in
peripheral seas. Based on multiple model simulations, the Labrador Sea stands out among the considered regions,
with sea ice predictability extending up to 1.5 years (Cruz-GarcÃ­a et al., 2019). Note that most of studies mentioned
above determine the changes in one variable, happening before another one, by applying time series analysis and/or
composite analysis based on observations, reanalysis or model output (Perovich et al., 2002; Sturm et al., 2002; Kay
and Gettelman, 2009; Wang et al., 2009; Nussbaumer and Pinker, 2012; Kapsch et al., 2013; Choi et al., 2014; Boisvert
et al., 2015; Boisvert and Stroeve, 2015; Cox et al., 2016; Huang et al., 2017; Huang et al., 2019b; Boisvert et al.,
2018; Wang et al., 2019). Among them, some studies use more advanced statistical analysis such as empirical orthogonal
function (Watanabe et al., 2006; Overland and Wang, 2010) and self-organizing map (Kapsch et al., 2019; Rinke et al.,
2019). Other studies assess the causal links through targeted modeling experiments (Bintanja and Selten, 2014; Kapsch
et al., 2016; Ding et al., 2017; Huang et al., 2019a; Cruz-GarcÃ­a et al., 2019), in order to test whether a manipulation
of one variable has an impact on others. And most of the studies focus on relationships between only one or two

(Ding et al., 2017; Huang et al., 2021; Luo et al., 2021). On the other hand, the reduction in Arctic sea ice extent
and increase in open water area in late summer are found to directly contribute to a modification of large-scale

Huang et al. Arctic Sea Ice Causality Discovery circulation patterns in the following autumn through the additional
heat stored in the Arctic Ocean and released to the atmosphere during the autumn (Overland and Wang, 2010). The
increased 1,000â€“500 hPa thickness in autumn produce anomalous easterley zonal wind component (u-component), especially
over the north of Alaska and Canada. Moreover, a more meridional flow pattern associated with sea ice reduction have
an impact on the mid-latitude weather (Overland and Wang, 2010). These conclusions are mainly drawn from model
simulations (Watanabe et al., 2006; Rinke et al., 2019), reanalysis and observations (Wang et al., 2009; Overland and
Wang, 2010; Kapsch et al., 2019). In addition to radiation, the sensible plus latent heat flux also plays an important
role in the Arctic energy budget. The increase in the downward moisture flux triggers the melting of the sea ice in
spring (Boisvert et al., 2015; Boisvert and Stroeve, 2015; Marcovecchio et al., 2021). Earlier melt onset and loss of
sea ice in the spring enhance warming of the ice-free ocean surface, which in turn leads to an increase of evaporation
from the surface into the atmosphere in the autumn. This positive feedback between heat flux and sea ice, indicated
by arrow h, has been confirmed by satellite observations (Boisvert et al., 2015; Boisvert and Stroeve, 2015) and model
simulations (Huang et al., 2019a) during most months of the year. The arrow i represents the influence of precipitation
on Arctic sea ice variations. Specifically, the magnitude of precipitation accumulating over the sea ice pack largely
determines the depth of the snow layer, which modulates the rate of sea ice growth because of its highly insulating
properties (Sturm et al., 2002). The phase of the precipitation falling on the sea ice pack is also important. As rain,
it can melt, compact, and densify the snowpack, thus reducing the surface albedo and promoting sea ice melt (Perovich
et al., 2002).The recent snowfall decline in summer is essentially caused by changes in precipitation form (snow
turning to rain) with very little influence of decreases in total precipitation, which is a result of
lower-atmospheric warming. Then the loss of snow-on-ice results in a substantial decrease in the surface albedo over
the Arctic Ocean, causing additional surface ice melt by absorbing more solar radiation (Screen and Simmonds, 2012).

CAUSALITY BETWEEN ATMOSPHERIC PROCESSES AND ARCTIC SEA ICE VARIATIONS
Due to the two-way interactions between the atmosphere and sea ice, studying causality between them is a challenging but
important task, which makes it an area of high interest within polar climate community. The sea ice variations can be
caused by different dynamical and thermodynamical processes. Important dynamical processes include anomalous surface
wind (Spreen et al., 2011; Wu et al., 2012), regional atmospheric circulation patterns (Overland and Wang, 2010;
Screen et al., 2018; Rinke et al., 2019) and abnormal storm activities (Simmonds et al., 2008; Simmonds and Keay, 2009;
Screen et al., 2011; Simmonds and Rudeva, 2012; Parkinson and Comiso, 2013; Simmonds and Rudeva, 2014). Cloud (Kapsch
et al., 2013), radiation (Kay and Gettelman, 2009; Choi et al., 2014) and precipitation (Boisvert et al., 2018; Wang
et al., 2019; Marcovecchio et al., 2021) are the important thermodynamic factors controlling Arctic sea ice trends
and variability. On the other hand, sea ice decline in turn exerts large influence on the atmosphere, including
cloud (Kay and Gettelman, 2009; Morrison et al., 2018), surface energy budget (Semmler et al., 2012; Boisvert et al.,
2015; Boisvert and Stroeve, 2015), precipitation (Bintanja and Selten, 2014; Kopec et al., 2016) and large-scale
circulation (Chemke et al., 2019; Kennel and Yulaeva, 2020). Figure 1 depicts the causal relations between key
atmospheric variables and sea ice over the Arctic. The sea ice here represents sea ice coverage and/or sea ice
thickness. Note that the processes a âˆ’ d are well-known atmospheric processes, including cloud microphysics,
thermodynamics, radiation, climate dynamics, which have been studied over the past few decades. The processes
e âˆ’ i are summarized from more recent publications, which are still under investigation by climate scientists.
We will explain processes e âˆ’ i in details in the next paragraph. The arrow e represents the two-way effect between
sea ice and net longwave flux at the surface. Based on global reanalysis (Kapsch et al., 2013; Lee et al., 2017),
surface (Cox et al., 2016) and satellite observations (Huang et al., 2017), as well as model simulations (Kapsch et
al., 2016; Huang et al., 2019a), the downward longwave radiation at the surface dominates surface warming and
therefore enhances sea ice melt in winter and spring. The increase in downward longwave flux is a result of an
increase in cloudiness and moisture in the Arctic Basin, which is caused by enhanced local evaporation or moisture
transport from mid-latitudes (Luo et al., 2017). Positive anomalies of longwave flux in spring and early summer
initiate an earlier melt onset, thereby triggering several feedback mechanisms which amplify melt during the
succeeding months (Kapsch et al., 2016; Huang et al., 2019b). The sea ice melt increases the air temperature

atmospheric processes with changes in Arctic sea ice. Therefore, in this study, we target to provide a more
comprehensive analysis about causality between multiple atmospheric processes and sea ice by applying different
data-driven causality approaches.

(Wang et al., 2009), winter (Watanabe et al., 2006) and spring (Kapsch et al., 2019) produces a strong meridional

transport of heat and moisture and thus enhances downward longwave radiation and control the melt onset
(Huang et al., 2019b; Kapsch et al., 2019). Moreover, the changes in cyclone occurrence and/or depth during spring

(latent heat flux) (Bintanja and Selten, 2014). Therefore, we believe that Arctic precipitation exerts direct influence

Specifically, the net shortwave flux at the surface in early summer (Mayâ€“July) is found to enhance sea ice melt with a

can be varied from a few days to a few years (Guemas et al., 2016). With sea ice anomaly persistence,
there is predictability for the sea ice area in winter but low predictability throughout the rest of the year in
peripheral seas. Based on multiple model simulations, the Labrador Sea stands out among the considered regions,
with sea ice predictability extending up to 1.5 years (Cruz-GarcÃ­a et al., 2019). Note that most of studies mentioned
above determine the changes in one variable, happening before another one, by applying time series analysis and/or
composite analysis based on observations, reanalysis or model output (Perovich et al., 2002; Sturm et al., 2002; Kay
and Gettelman, 2009; Wang et al., 2009; Nussbaumer and Pinker, 2012; Kapsch et al., 2013; Choi et al., 2014; Boisvert

2018; Wang et al., 2019). Among them, some studies use more advanced statistical analysis such as empirical orthogonal
function (Watanabe et al., 2006; Overland and Wang, 2010) and self-organizing map (Kapsch et al., 2019; Rinke et al.,
2019). Other studies assess the causal links through targeted modeling experiments (Bintanja and Selten, 2014; Kapsch
et al., 2016; Ding et al., 2017; Huang et al., 2019a; Cruz-GarcÃ­a et al., 2019), in order to test whether a manipulation
of one variable has an impact on others. And most of the studies focus on relationships between only one or two

(Ding et al., 2017; Huang et al., 2021; Luo et al., 2021). On the other hand, the reduction in Arctic sea ice extent
and increase in open water area in late summer are found to directly contribute to a modification of large-scale

Huang et al. Arctic Sea Ice Causality Discovery circulation patterns in the following autumn through the additional
heat stored in the Arctic Ocean and released to the atmosphere during the autumn (Overland and Wang, 2010). The
increased 1,000â€“500 hPa thickness in autumn produce anomalous easterley zonal wind component (u-component), especially
over the north of Alaska and Canada. Moreover, a more meridional flow pattern associated with sea ice reduction have
an impact on the mid-latitude weather (Overland and Wang, 2010). These conclusions are mainly drawn from model
simulations (Watanabe et al., 2006; Rinke et al., 2019), reanalysis and observations (Wang et al., 2009; Overland and
Wang, 2010; Kapsch et al., 2019). In addition to radiation, the sensible plus latent heat flux also plays an important
role in the Arctic energy budget. The increase in the downward moisture flux triggers the melting of the sea ice in
spring (Boisvert et al., 2015; Boisvert and Stroeve, 2015; Marcovecchio et al., 2021). Earlier melt onset and loss of
sea ice in the spring enhance warming of the ice-free ocean surface, which in turn leads to an increase of evaporation
from the surface into the atmosphere in the autumn. This positive feedback between heat flux and sea ice, indicated
by arrow h, has been confirmed by satellite observations (Boisvert et al., 2015; Boisvert and Stroeve, 2015) and model
simulations (Huang et al., 2019a) during most months of the year. The arrow i represents the influence of precipitation
on Arctic sea ice variations. Specifically, the magnitude of precipitation accumulating over the sea ice pack largely
determines the depth of the snow layer, which modulates the rate of sea ice growth because of its highly insulating
properties (Sturm et al., 2002). The phase of the precipitation falling on the sea ice pack is also important. As rain,
it can melt, compact, and densify the snowpack, thus reducing the surface albedo and promoting sea ice melt (Perovich
et al., 2002).The recent snowfall decline in summer is essentially caused by changes in precipitation form (snow
turning to rain) with very little influence of decreases in total precipitation, which is a result of
lower-atmospheric warming. Then the loss of snow-on-ice results in a substantial decrease in the surface albedo over
the Arctic Ocean, causing additional surface ice melt by absorbing more solar radiation (Screen and Simmonds, 2012).

CAUSALITY BETWEEN ATMOSPHERIC PROCESSES AND ARCTIC SEA ICE VARIATIONS
Due to the two-way interactions between the atmosphere and sea ice, studying causality between them is a challenging but
important task, which makes it an area of high interest within polar climate community. The sea ice variations can be
caused by different dynamical and thermodynamical processes. Important dynamical processes include anomalous surface
wind (Spreen et al., 2011; Wu et al., 2012), regional atmospheric circulation patterns (Overland and Wang, 2010;
Screen et al., 2018; Rinke et al., 2019) and abnormal storm activities (Simmonds et al., 2008; Simmonds and Keay, 2009;
Screen et al., 2011; Simmonds and Rudeva, 2012; Parkinson and Comiso, 2013; Simmonds and Rudeva, 2014). Cloud (Kapsch
et al., 2013), radiation (Kay and Gettelman, 2009; Choi et al., 2014) and precipitation (Boisvert et al., 2018; Wang
et al., 2019; Marcovecchio et al., 2021) are the important thermodynamic factors controlling Arctic sea ice trends
and variability. On the other hand, sea ice decline in turn exerts large influence on the atmosphere, including
cloud (Kay and Gettelman, 2009; Morrison et al., 2018), surface energy budget (Semmler et al., 2012; Boisvert et al.,
2015; Boisvert and Stroeve, 2015), precipitation (Bintanja and Selten, 2014; Kopec et al., 2016) and large-scale
circulation (Chemke et al., 2019; Kennel and Yulaeva, 2020). Figure 1 depicts the causal relations between key
atmospheric variables and sea ice over the Arctic. The sea ice here represents sea ice coverage and/or sea ice
thickness. Note that the processes a âˆ’ d are well-known atmospheric processes, including cloud microphysics,
thermodynamics, radiation, climate dynamics, which have been studied over the past few decades. The processes
e âˆ’ i are summarized from more recent publications, which are still under investigation by climate scientists.
We will explain processes e âˆ’ i in details in the next paragraph. The arrow e represents the two-way effect between
sea ice and net longwave flux at the surface. Based on global reanalysis (Kapsch et al., 2013; Lee et al., 2017),
surface (Cox et al., 2016) and satellite observations (Huang et al., 2017), as well as model simulations (Kapsch et
al., 2016; Huang et al., 2019a), the downward longwave radiation at the surface dominates surface warming and
therefore enhances sea ice melt in winter and spring. The increase in downward longwave flux is a result of an
increase in cloudiness and moisture in the Arctic Basin, which is caused by enhanced local evaporation or moisture
transport from mid-latitudes (Luo et al., 2017). Positive anomalies of longwave flux in spring and early summer
initiate an earlier melt onset, thereby triggering several feedback mechanisms which amplify melt during the
succeeding months (Kapsch et al., 2016; Huang et al., 2019b). The sea ice melt increases the air temperature

atmospheric processes with changes in Arctic sea ice. Therefore, in this study, we target to provide a more
comprehensive analysis about causality between multiple atmospheric processes and sea ice by applying different
data-driven causality approaches.

Huang et al. Arctic Sea Ice Causality Discovery surface. The downward shortwave flux, however, appears only
important after the melt has started (Kapsch et al., 2013; Huang et al., 2017). Once the surface albedo is
significantly reduced due to sea ice melt, the solar radiation could be absorbed by ocean, which further
accelerates ice melt in late spring and summer (Kay and Gettelman, 2009; Choi et al., 2014; Kapsch et al., 2016).
The feedback between surface net shortwave flux and sea ice, represented by arrow f in Figure 1, has been
confirmed by both model simulations (Kapsch et al., 2016) and satellite observations (Kay and Gettelman, 2009;
Nussbaumer and Pinker, 2012; Choi et al., 2014). The arrows g indicate the interactions between the sea ice variations
and atmospheric dynamical processes. A series of studies demonstrated that recent loss of Arctic sea ice is triggered
by the atmospheric circulation changes such as a tendency toward a dipole pattern in the mean sea level pressure trend
with an increase over the Arctic Ocean and a decrease over Siberia. The Arctic dipole anomaly in summer
(Wang et al., 2009), winter (Watanabe et al., 2006) and spring (Kapsch et al., 2019) produces a strong meridional
wind (v-component) anomaly that drives more sea ice out of the Arctic Ocean. In addition, this dipole anomaly promotes
transport of heat and moisture and thus enhances downward longwave radiation and control the melt onset
(Huang et al., 2019b; Kapsch et al., 2019). Moreover, the changes in cyclone occurrence and/or depth during spring
(Screen et al., 2011) and summer (Simmonds and Rudeva, 2012) have preconditioning effects on the sea ice cover and
exert a strong influence on the amount of sea ice that survives the melt season. A recent study also pointed out that
a stronger anticyclonic circulation over Greenland and the Arctic Ocean in the troposphere may have contributed as much
as 60% to the September sea ice extent decline since 1979, by warming and moistening the lower atmosphere

These conclusions are mainly drawn from in-situ measurements during field campaign (Perovich et al., 2002; Sturm et al.,
2002), global reanalysis products and surface observations (Screen and Simmonds, 2012; Boisvert et al., 2018;
Wang et al., 2019). The higher precipitation and snowfall could result in a thicker snowpack that allows less heat
loss to the atmosphere. More importantly, modeling studies suggest that increases in Arctic precipitation over the
21st century, particularly in late autumn and winter, are due mainly to strongly intensified local surface evaporation
(latent heat flux) (Bintanja and Selten, 2014). Therefore, we believe that Arctic precipitation exerts direct influence
on sea ice variations (arrow i), while sea ice modulates precipitation mainly through sensible plus latent heat flux
(arrows h, b). Among these studies, very few of them have demonstrated the delayed impact of one variable on another.
Specifically, the net shortwave flux at the surface in early summer (Mayâ€“July) is found to enhance sea ice melt with a
lag of 1â€“4 months (Choi et al., 2014). Moreover, the sea ice condition exhibits the delayed impacts on itself, which is
called sea ice anomaly persistence (Guemas et al., 2016; Cruz-GarcÃ­a et al., 2019; Holland et al., 2019). The sea ice
anomaly persistence depends on the predictand (area, extent, volume), region, and the initial and target dates, which
can be varied from a few days to a few years (Guemas et al., 2016). With sea ice anomaly persistence,
there is predictability for the sea ice area in winter but low predictability throughout the rest of the year in
peripheral seas. Based on multiple model simulations, the Labrador Sea stands out among the considered regions,
with sea ice predictability extending up to 1.5 years (Cruz-GarcÃ­a et al., 2019). Note that most of studies mentioned

on Arctic sea ice variations. Specifically, the magnitude of precipitation accumulating over the sea ice pack largely
determines the depth of the snow layer, which modulates the rate of sea ice growth because of its highly insulating
properties (Sturm et al., 2002). The phase of the precipitation falling on the sea ice pack is also important. As rain,
it can melt, compact, and densify the snowpack, thus reducing the surface albedo and promoting sea ice melt (Perovich
et al., 2002).The recent snowfall decline in summer is essentially caused by changes in precipitation form (snow
turning to rain) with very little influence of decreases in total precipitation, which is a result of
lower-atmospheric warming. Then the loss of snow-on-ice results in a substantial decrease in the surface albedo over
the Arctic Ocean, causing additional surface ice melt by absorbing more solar radiation (Screen and Simmonds, 2012).

CAUSALITY BETWEEN ATMOSPHERIC PROCESSES AND ARCTIC SEA ICE VARIATIONS
Due to the two-way interactions between the atmosphere and sea ice, studying causality between them is a challenging but
important task, which makes it an area of high interest within polar climate community. The sea ice variations can be
caused by different dynamical and thermodynamical processes. Important dynamical processes include anomalous surface
wind (Spreen et al., 2011; Wu et al., 2012), regional atmospheric circulation patterns (Overland and Wang, 2010;
Screen et al., 2018; Rinke et al., 2019) and abnormal storm activities (Simmonds et al., 2008; Simmonds and Keay, 2009;
Screen et al., 2011; Simmonds and Rudeva, 2012; Parkinson and Comiso, 2013; Simmonds and Rudeva, 2014). Cloud (Kapsch
et al., 2013), radiation (Kay and Gettelman, 2009; Choi et al., 2014) and precipitation (Boisvert et al., 2018; Wang
et al., 2019; Marcovecchio et al., 2021) are the important thermodynamic factors controlling Arctic sea ice trends
and variability. On the other hand, sea ice decline in turn exerts large influence on the atmosphere, including
cloud (Kay and Gettelman, 2009; Morrison et al., 2018), surface energy budget (Semmler et al., 2012; Boisvert et al.,
2015; Boisvert and Stroeve, 2015), precipitation (Bintanja and Selten, 2014; Kopec et al., 2016) and large-scale
circulation (Chemke et al., 2019; Kennel and Yulaeva, 2020). Figure 1 depicts the causal relations between key
atmospheric variables and sea ice over the Arctic. The sea ice here represents sea ice coverage and/or sea ice
thickness. Note that the processes a âˆ’ d are well-known atmospheric processes, including cloud microphysics,
thermodynamics, radiation, climate dynamics, which have been studied over the past few decades. The processes
e âˆ’ i are summarized from more recent publications, which are still under investigation by climate scientists.
We will explain processes e âˆ’ i in details in the next paragraph. The arrow e represents the two-way effect between
sea ice and net longwave flux at the surface. Based on global reanalysis (Kapsch et al., 2013; Lee et al., 2017),
surface (Cox et al., 2016) and satellite observations (Huang et al., 2017), as well as model simulations (Kapsch et
al., 2016; Huang et al., 2019a), the downward longwave radiation at the surface dominates surface warming and
therefore enhances sea ice melt in winter and spring. The increase in downward longwave flux is a result of an
increase in cloudiness and moisture in the Arctic Basin, which is caused by enhanced local evaporation or moisture
transport from mid-latitudes (Luo et al., 2017). Positive anomalies of longwave flux in spring and early summer
initiate an earlier melt onset, thereby triggering several feedback mechanisms which amplify melt during the
succeeding months (Kapsch et al., 2016; Huang et al., 2019b). The sea ice melt increases the air temperature

atmospheric processes with changes in Arctic sea ice. Therefore, in this study, we target to provide a more
comprehensive analysis about causality between multiple atmospheric processes and sea ice by applying different
data-driven causality approaches.

According to the context, the arrow h represents the influence of sensible plus latent heat flux on sea ice variations. It states that the increase in downward moisture flux triggers the melting of sea ice in spring, and the earlier melt onset and loss of sea ice enhance warming of the ice-free ocean surface, leading to an increase in evaporation from the surface into the atmosphere in the autumn. This positive feedback between heat flux and sea ice has been confirmed by satellite observations and model simulations during most months of the year.

Huang et al. Arctic Sea Ice Causality Discovery surface. The downward shortwave flux, however, appears only
important after the melt has started (Kapsch et al., 2013; Huang et al., 2017). Once the surface albedo is
significantly reduced due to sea ice melt, the solar radiation could be absorbed by ocean, which further
accelerates ice melt in late spring and summer (Kay and Gettelman, 2009; Choi et al., 2014; Kapsch et al., 2016).
The feedback between surface net shortwave flux and sea ice, represented by arrow f in Figure 1, has been
confirmed by both model simulations (Kapsch et al., 2016) and satellite observations (Kay and Gettelman, 2009;
Nussbaumer and Pinker, 2012; Choi et al., 2014). The arrows g indicate the interactions between the sea ice variations
and atmospheric dynamical processes. A series of studies demonstrated that recent loss of Arctic sea ice is triggered
by the atmospheric circulation changes such as a tendency toward a dipole pattern in the mean sea level pressure trend
with an increase over the Arctic Ocean and a decrease over Siberia. The Arctic dipole anomaly in summer
(Wang et al., 2009), winter (Watanabe et al., 2006) and spring (Kapsch et al., 2019) produces a strong meridional
wind (v-component) anomaly that drives more sea ice out of the Arctic Ocean. In addition, this dipole anomaly promotes
transport of heat and moisture and thus enhances downward longwave radiation and control the melt onset
(Huang et al., 2019b; Kapsch et al., 2019). Moreover, the changes in cyclone occurrence and/or depth during spring
(Screen et al., 2011) and summer (Simmonds and Rudeva, 2012) have preconditioning effects on the sea ice cover and
exert a strong influence on the amount of sea ice that survives the melt season. A recent study also pointed out that
a stronger anticyclonic circulation over Greenland and the Arctic Ocean in the troposphere may have contributed as much
as 60% to the September sea ice extent decline since 1979, by warming and moistening the lower atmosphere

These conclusions are mainly drawn from in-situ measurements during field campaign (Perovich et al., 2002; Sturm et al.,
2002), global reanalysis products and surface observations (Screen and Simmonds, 2012; Boisvert et al., 2018;
Wang et al., 2019). The higher precipitation and snowfall could result in a thicker snowpack that allows less heat
loss to the atmosphere. More importantly, modeling studies suggest that increases in Arctic precipitation over the
21st century, particularly in late autumn and winter, are due mainly to strongly intensified local surface evaporation
(latent heat flux) (Bintanja and Selten, 2014). Therefore, we believe that Arctic precipitation exerts direct influence
on sea ice variations (arrow i), while sea ice modulates precipitation mainly through sensible plus latent heat flux
(arrows h, b). Among these studies, very few of them have demonstrated the delayed impact of one variable on another.
Specifically, the net shortwave flux at the surface in early summer (Mayâ€“July) is found to enhance sea ice melt with a
lag of 1â€“4 months (Choi et al., 2014). Moreover, the sea ice condition exhibits the delayed impacts on itself, which is
called sea ice anomaly persistence (Guemas et al., 2016; Cruz-GarcÃ­a et al., 2019; Holland et al., 2019). The sea ice
anomaly persistence depends on the predictand (area, extent, volume), region, and the initial and target dates, which
can be varied from a few days to a few years (Guemas et al., 2016). With sea ice anomaly persistence,
there is predictability for the sea ice area in winter but low predictability throughout the rest of the year in
peripheral seas. Based on multiple model simulations, the Labrador Sea stands out among the considered regions,
with sea ice predictability extending up to 1.5 years (Cruz-GarcÃ­a et al., 2019). Note that most of studies mentioned
above determine the changes in one variable, happening before another one, by applying time series analysis and/or
composite analysis based on observations, reanalysis or model output (Perovich et al., 2002; Sturm et al., 2002; Kay
and Gettelman, 2009; Wang et al., 2009; Nussbaumer and Pinker, 2012; Kapsch et al., 2013; Choi et al., 2014; Boisvert
et al., 2015; Boisvert and Stroeve, 2015; Cox et al., 2016; Huang et al., 2017; Huang et al., 2019b; Boisvert et al.,
2018; Wang et al., 2019). Among them, some studies use more advanced statistical analysis such as empirical orthogonal
function (Watanabe et al., 2006; Overland and Wang, 2010) and self-organizing map (Kapsch et al., 2019; Rinke et al.,
2019). Other studies assess the causal links through targeted modeling experiments (Bintanja and Selten, 2014; Kapsch
et al., 2016; Ding et al., 2017; Huang et al., 2019a; Cruz-GarcÃ­a et al., 2019), in order to test whether a manipulation
of one variable has an impact on others. And most of the studies focus on relationships between only one or two

(Ding et al., 2017; Huang et al., 2021; Luo et al., 2021). On the other hand, the reduction in Arctic sea ice extent
and increase in open water area in late summer are found to directly contribute to a modification of large-scale

Huang et al. Arctic Sea Ice Causality Discovery circulation patterns in the following autumn through the additional
heat stored in the Arctic Ocean and released to the atmosphere during the autumn (Overland and Wang, 2010). The
increased 1,000â€“500 hPa thickness in autumn produce anomalous easterley zonal wind component (u-component), especially
over the north of Alaska and Canada. Moreover, a more meridional flow pattern associated with sea ice reduction have
an impact on the mid-latitude weather (Overland and Wang, 2010). These conclusions are mainly drawn from model
simulations (Watanabe et al., 2006; Rinke et al., 2019), reanalysis and observations (Wang et al., 2009; Overland and
Wang, 2010; Kapsch et al., 2019). In addition to radiation, the sensible plus latent heat flux also plays an important
role in the Arctic energy budget. The increase in the downward moisture flux triggers the melting of the sea ice in
spring (Boisvert et al., 2015; Boisvert and Stroeve, 2015; Marcovecchio et al., 2021). Earlier melt onset and loss of
sea ice in the spring enhance warming of the ice-free ocean surface, which in turn leads to an increase of evaporation
from the surface into the atmosphere in the autumn. This positive feedback between heat flux and sea ice, indicated
by arrow h, has been confirmed by satellite observations (Boisvert et al., 2015; Boisvert and Stroeve, 2015) and model

surface (Cox et al., 2016) and satellite observations (Huang et al., 2017), as well as model simulations (Kapsch et
al., 2016; Huang et al., 2019a), the downward longwave radiation at the surface dominates surface warming and
therefore enhances sea ice melt in winter and spring. The increase in downward longwave flux is a result of an
increase in cloudiness and moisture in the Arctic Basin, which is caused by enhanced local evaporation or moisture
transport from mid-latitudes (Luo et al., 2017). Positive anomalies of longwave flux in spring and early summer
initiate an earlier melt onset, thereby triggering several feedback mechanisms which amplify melt during the
succeeding months (Kapsch et al., 2016; Huang et al., 2019b). The sea ice melt increases the air temperature

atmospheric processes with changes in Arctic sea ice. Therefore, in this study, we target to provide a more
comprehensive analysis about causality between multiple atmospheric processes and sea ice by applying different
data-driven causality approaches.

90,"To determine if meridional (v-component) wind at 10 m (v10m) is a direct cause of net longwave flux at the surface (LW), we need to examine the information provided in the context.

According to the context, the arrow e in Figure 1 represents the two-way effect between sea ice and net longwave flux at the surface. It states that the increase in downward longwave flux is a result of an increase in cloudiness and moisture in the Arctic Basin, which is caused by enhanced local evaporation or moisture transport from mid-latitudes. Positive anomalies of longwave flux in spring and early summer initiate an earlier melt onset, thereby triggering several feedback mechanisms which amplify melt during the succeeding months.

Based on this information, it can be inferred that meridional wind at 10 m (v10m) is not a direct cause of net longwave flux at the surface (LW). The increase in longwave flux is primarily driven by changes in cloudiness and moisture, which are influenced by enhanced local evaporation or moisture transport from mid-latitudes.

Huang et al. Arctic Sea Ice Causality Discovery surface. The downward shortwave flux, however, appears only
important after the melt has started (Kapsch et al., 2013; Huang et al., 2017). Once the surface albedo is
significantly reduced due to sea ice melt, the solar radiation could be absorbed by ocean, which further
accelerates ice melt in late spring and summer (Kay and Gettelman, 2009; Choi et al., 2014; Kapsch et al., 2016).
The feedback between surface net shortwave flux and sea ice, represented by arrow f in Figure 1, has been
confirmed by both model simulations (Kapsch et al., 2016) and satellite observations (Kay and Gettelman, 2009;
Nussbaumer and Pinker, 2012; Choi et al., 2014). The arrows g indicate the interactions between the sea ice variations
and atmospheric dynamical processes. A series of studies demonstrated that recent loss of Arctic sea ice is triggered
by the atmospheric circulation changes such as a tendency toward a dipole pattern in the mean sea level pressure trend
with an increase over the Arctic Ocean and a decrease over Siberia. The Arctic dipole anomaly in summer
(Wang et al., 2009), winter (Watanabe et al., 2006) and spring (Kapsch et al., 2019) produces a strong meridional
wind (v-component) anomaly that drives more sea ice out of the Arctic Ocean. In addition, this dipole anomaly promotes
transport of heat and moisture and thus enhances downward longwave radiation and control the melt onset
(Huang et al., 2019b; Kapsch et al., 2019). Moreover, the changes in cyclone occurrence and/or depth during spring
(Screen et al., 2011) and summer (Simmonds and Rudeva, 2012) have preconditioning effects on the sea ice cover and
exert a strong influence on the amount of sea ice that survives the melt season. A recent study also pointed out that
a stronger anticyclonic circulation over Greenland and the Arctic Ocean in the troposphere may have contributed as much
as 60% to the September sea ice extent decline since 1979, by warming and moistening the lower atmosphere

These conclusions are mainly drawn from in-situ measurements during field campaign (Perovich et al., 2002; Sturm et al.,
2002), global reanalysis products and surface observations (Screen and Simmonds, 2012; Boisvert et al., 2018;
Wang et al., 2019). The higher precipitation and snowfall could result in a thicker snowpack that allows less heat
loss to the atmosphere. More importantly, modeling studies suggest that increases in Arctic precipitation over the
21st century, particularly in late autumn and winter, are due mainly to strongly intensified local surface evaporation
(latent heat flux) (Bintanja and Selten, 2014). Therefore, we believe that Arctic precipitation exerts direct influence
on sea ice variations (arrow i), while sea ice modulates precipitation mainly through sensible plus latent heat flux
(arrows h, b). Among these studies, very few of them have demonstrated the delayed impact of one variable on another.
Specifically, the net shortwave flux at the surface in early summer (Mayâ€“July) is found to enhance sea ice melt with a
lag of 1â€“4 months (Choi et al., 2014). Moreover, the sea ice condition exhibits the delayed impacts on itself, which is
called sea ice anomaly persistence (Guemas et al., 2016; Cruz-GarcÃ­a et al., 2019; Holland et al., 2019). The sea ice
anomaly persistence depends on the predictand (area, extent, volume), region, and the initial and target dates, which
can be varied from a few days to a few years (Guemas et al., 2016). With sea ice anomaly persistence,
there is predictability for the sea ice area in winter but low predictability throughout the rest of the year in
peripheral seas. Based on multiple model simulations, the Labrador Sea stands out among the considered regions,
with sea ice predictability extending up to 1.5 years (Cruz-GarcÃ­a et al., 2019). Note that most of studies mentioned
above determine the changes in one variable, happening before another one, by applying time series analysis and/or
composite analysis based on observations, reanalysis or model output (Perovich et al., 2002; Sturm et al., 2002; Kay
and Gettelman, 2009; Wang et al., 2009; Nussbaumer and Pinker, 2012; Kapsch et al., 2013; Choi et al., 2014; Boisvert
et al., 2015; Boisvert and Stroeve, 2015; Cox et al., 2016; Huang et al., 2017; Huang et al., 2019b; Boisvert et al.,
2018; Wang et al., 2019). Among them, some studies use more advanced statistical analysis such as empirical orthogonal
function (Watanabe et al., 2006; Overland and Wang, 2010) and self-organizing map (Kapsch et al., 2019; Rinke et al.,
2019). Other studies assess the causal links through targeted modeling experiments (Bintanja and Selten, 2014; Kapsch
et al., 2016; Ding et al., 2017; Huang et al., 2019a; Cruz-GarcÃ­a et al., 2019), in order to test whether a manipulation
of one variable has an impact on others. And most of the studies focus on relationships between only one or two

(Ding et al., 2017; Huang et al., 2021; Luo et al., 2021). On the other hand, the reduction in Arctic sea ice extent
and increase in open water area in late summer are found to directly contribute to a modification of large-scale

Huang et al. Arctic Sea Ice Causality Discovery circulation patterns in the following autumn through the additional
heat stored in the Arctic Ocean and released to the atmosphere during the autumn (Overland and Wang, 2010). The
increased 1,000â€“500 hPa thickness in autumn produce anomalous easterley zonal wind component (u-component), especially
over the north of Alaska and Canada. Moreover, a more meridional flow pattern associated with sea ice reduction have
an impact on the mid-latitude weather (Overland and Wang, 2010). These conclusions are mainly drawn from model
simulations (Watanabe et al., 2006; Rinke et al., 2019), reanalysis and observations (Wang et al., 2009; Overland and
Wang, 2010; Kapsch et al., 2019). In addition to radiation, the sensible plus latent heat flux also plays an important
role in the Arctic energy budget. The increase in the downward moisture flux triggers the melting of the sea ice in
spring (Boisvert et al., 2015; Boisvert and Stroeve, 2015; Marcovecchio et al., 2021). Earlier melt onset and loss of
sea ice in the spring enhance warming of the ice-free ocean surface, which in turn leads to an increase of evaporation
from the surface into the atmosphere in the autumn. This positive feedback between heat flux and sea ice, indicated
by arrow h, has been confirmed by satellite observations (Boisvert et al., 2015; Boisvert and Stroeve, 2015) and model
simulations (Huang et al., 2019a) during most months of the year. The arrow i represents the influence of precipitation
on Arctic sea ice variations. Specifically, the magnitude of precipitation accumulating over the sea ice pack largely
determines the depth of the snow layer, which modulates the rate of sea ice growth because of its highly insulating
properties (Sturm et al., 2002). The phase of the precipitation falling on the sea ice pack is also important. As rain,
it can melt, compact, and densify the snowpack, thus reducing the surface albedo and promoting sea ice melt (Perovich
et al., 2002).The recent snowfall decline in summer is essentially caused by changes in precipitation form (snow
turning to rain) with very little influence of decreases in total precipitation, which is a result of
lower-atmospheric warming. Then the loss of snow-on-ice results in a substantial decrease in the surface albedo over
the Arctic Ocean, causing additional surface ice melt by absorbing more solar radiation (Screen and Simmonds, 2012).

CAUSALITY BETWEEN ATMOSPHERIC PROCESSES AND ARCTIC SEA ICE VARIATIONS
Due to the two-way interactions between the atmosphere and sea ice, studying causality between them is a challenging but
important task, which makes it an area of high interest within polar climate community. The sea ice variations can be
caused by different dynamical and thermodynamical processes. Important dynamical processes include anomalous surface
wind (Spreen et al., 2011; Wu et al., 2012), regional atmospheric circulation patterns (Overland and Wang, 2010;
Screen et al., 2018; Rinke et al., 2019) and abnormal storm activities (Simmonds et al., 2008; Simmonds and Keay, 2009;
Screen et al., 2011; Simmonds and Rudeva, 2012; Parkinson and Comiso, 2013; Simmonds and Rudeva, 2014). Cloud (Kapsch
et al., 2013), radiation (Kay and Gettelman, 2009; Choi et al., 2014) and precipitation (Boisvert et al., 2018; Wang
et al., 2019; Marcovecchio et al., 2021) are the important thermodynamic factors controlling Arctic sea ice trends
and variability. On the other hand, sea ice decline in turn exerts large influence on the atmosphere, including
cloud (Kay and Gettelman, 2009; Morrison et al., 2018), surface energy budget (Semmler et al., 2012; Boisvert et al.,
2015; Boisvert and Stroeve, 2015), precipitation (Bintanja and Selten, 2014; Kopec et al., 2016) and large-scale
circulation (Chemke et al., 2019; Kennel and Yulaeva, 2020). Figure 1 depicts the causal relations between key
atmospheric variables and sea ice over the Arctic. The sea ice here represents sea ice coverage and/or sea ice
thickness. Note that the processes a âˆ’ d are well-known atmospheric processes, including cloud microphysics,
thermodynamics, radiation, climate dynamics, which have been studied over the past few decades. The processes
e âˆ’ i are summarized from more recent publications, which are still under investigation by climate scientists.
We will explain processes e âˆ’ i in details in the next paragraph. The arrow e represents the two-way effect between
sea ice and net longwave flux at the surface. Based on global reanalysis (Kapsch et al., 2013; Lee et al., 2017),

Huang et al. Arctic Sea Ice Causality Discovery surface. The downward shortwave flux, however, appears only
important after the melt has started (Kapsch et al., 2013; Huang et al., 2017). Once the surface albedo is
significantly reduced due to sea ice melt, the solar radiation could be absorbed by ocean, which further
accelerates ice melt in late spring and summer (Kay and Gettelman, 2009; Choi et al., 2014; Kapsch et al., 2016).
The feedback between surface net shortwave flux and sea ice, represented by arrow f in Figure 1, has been
confirmed by both model simulations (Kapsch et al., 2016) and satellite observations (Kay and Gettelman, 2009;
Nussbaumer and Pinker, 2012; Choi et al., 2014). The arrows g indicate the interactions between the sea ice variations
and atmospheric dynamical processes. A series of studies demonstrated that recent loss of Arctic sea ice is triggered
by the atmospheric circulation changes such as a tendency toward a dipole pattern in the mean sea level pressure trend
with an increase over the Arctic Ocean and a decrease over Siberia. The Arctic dipole anomaly in summer
(Wang et al., 2009), winter (Watanabe et al., 2006) and spring (Kapsch et al., 2019) produces a strong meridional
wind (v-component) anomaly that drives more sea ice out of the Arctic Ocean. In addition, this dipole anomaly promotes
transport of heat and moisture and thus enhances downward longwave radiation and control the melt onset
(Huang et al., 2019b; Kapsch et al., 2019). Moreover, the changes in cyclone occurrence and/or depth during spring
(Screen et al., 2011) and summer (Simmonds and Rudeva, 2012) have preconditioning effects on the sea ice cover and
exert a strong influence on the amount of sea ice that survives the melt season. A recent study also pointed out that
a stronger anticyclonic circulation over Greenland and the Arctic Ocean in the troposphere may have contributed as much
as 60% to the September sea ice extent decline since 1979, by warming and moistening the lower atmosphere

These conclusions are mainly drawn from in-situ measurements during field campaign (Perovich et al., 2002; Sturm et al.,
2002), global reanalysis products and surface observations (Screen and Simmonds, 2012; Boisvert et al., 2018;
Wang et al., 2019). The higher precipitation and snowfall could result in a thicker snowpack that allows less heat
loss to the atmosphere. More importantly, modeling studies suggest that increases in Arctic precipitation over the
21st century, particularly in late autumn and winter, are due mainly to strongly intensified local surface evaporation
(latent heat flux) (Bintanja and Selten, 2014). Therefore, we believe that Arctic precipitation exerts direct influence
on sea ice variations (arrow i), while sea ice modulates precipitation mainly through sensible plus latent heat flux
(arrows h, b). Among these studies, very few of them have demonstrated the delayed impact of one variable on another.
Specifically, the net shortwave flux at the surface in early summer (Mayâ€“July) is found to enhance sea ice melt with a
lag of 1â€“4 months (Choi et al., 2014). Moreover, the sea ice condition exhibits the delayed impacts on itself, which is
called sea ice anomaly persistence (Guemas et al., 2016; Cruz-GarcÃ­a et al., 2019; Holland et al., 2019). The sea ice
anomaly persistence depends on the predictand (area, extent, volume), region, and the initial and target dates, which
can be varied from a few days to a few years (Guemas et al., 2016). With sea ice anomaly persistence,
there is predictability for the sea ice area in winter but low predictability throughout the rest of the year in
peripheral seas. Based on multiple model simulations, the Labrador Sea stands out among the considered regions,
with sea ice predictability extending up to 1.5 years (Cruz-GarcÃ­a et al., 2019). Note that most of studies mentioned
above determine the changes in one variable, happening before another one, by applying time series analysis and/or
composite analysis based on observations, reanalysis or model output (Perovich et al., 2002; Sturm et al., 2002; Kay
and Gettelman, 2009; Wang et al., 2009; Nussbaumer and Pinker, 2012; Kapsch et al., 2013; Choi et al., 2014; Boisvert

2018; Wang et al., 2019). Among them, some studies use more advanced statistical analysis such as empirical orthogonal
function (Watanabe et al., 2006; Overland and Wang, 2010) and self-organizing map (Kapsch et al., 2019; Rinke et al.,
2019). Other studies assess the causal links through targeted modeling experiments (Bintanja and Selten, 2014; Kapsch
et al., 2016; Ding et al., 2017; Huang et al., 2019a; Cruz-GarcÃ­a et al., 2019), in order to test whether a manipulation
of one variable has an impact on others. And most of the studies focus on relationships between only one or two

(Ding et al., 2017; Huang et al., 2021; Luo et al., 2021). On the other hand, the reduction in Arctic sea ice extent
and increase in open water area in late summer are found to directly contribute to a modification of large-scale

Huang et al. Arctic Sea Ice Causality Discovery circulation patterns in the following autumn through the additional
heat stored in the Arctic Ocean and released to the atmosphere during the autumn (Overland and Wang, 2010). The
increased 1,000â€“500 hPa thickness in autumn produce anomalous easterley zonal wind component (u-component), especially
over the north of Alaska and Canada. Moreover, a more meridional flow pattern associated with sea ice reduction have
an impact on the mid-latitude weather (Overland and Wang, 2010). These conclusions are mainly drawn from model
simulations (Watanabe et al., 2006; Rinke et al., 2019), reanalysis and observations (Wang et al., 2009; Overland and
Wang, 2010; Kapsch et al., 2019). In addition to radiation, the sensible plus latent heat flux also plays an important
role in the Arctic energy budget. The increase in the downward moisture flux triggers the melting of the sea ice in
spring (Boisvert et al., 2015; Boisvert and Stroeve, 2015; Marcovecchio et al., 2021). Earlier melt onset and loss of
sea ice in the spring enhance warming of the ice-free ocean surface, which in turn leads to an increase of evaporation
from the surface into the atmosphere in the autumn. This positive feedback between heat flux and sea ice, indicated
by arrow h, has been confirmed by satellite observations (Boisvert et al., 2015; Boisvert and Stroeve, 2015) and model
simulations (Huang et al., 2019a) during most months of the year. The arrow i represents the influence of precipitation
on Arctic sea ice variations. Specifically, the magnitude of precipitation accumulating over the sea ice pack largely
determines the depth of the snow layer, which modulates the rate of sea ice growth because of its highly insulating
properties (Sturm et al., 2002). The phase of the precipitation falling on the sea ice pack is also important. As rain,
it can melt, compact, and densify the snowpack, thus reducing the surface albedo and promoting sea ice melt (Perovich
et al., 2002).The recent snowfall decline in summer is essentially caused by changes in precipitation form (snow
turning to rain) with very little influence of decreases in total precipitation, which is a result of
lower-atmospheric warming. Then the loss of snow-on-ice results in a substantial decrease in the surface albedo over
the Arctic Ocean, causing additional surface ice melt by absorbing more solar radiation (Screen and Simmonds, 2012).

CAUSALITY BETWEEN ATMOSPHERIC PROCESSES AND ARCTIC SEA ICE VARIATIONS
Due to the two-way interactions between the atmosphere and sea ice, studying causality between them is a challenging but
important task, which makes it an area of high interest within polar climate community. The sea ice variations can be
caused by different dynamical and thermodynamical processes. Important dynamical processes include anomalous surface
wind (Spreen et al., 2011; Wu et al., 2012), regional atmospheric circulation patterns (Overland and Wang, 2010;
Screen et al., 2018; Rinke et al., 2019) and abnormal storm activities (Simmonds et al., 2008; Simmonds and Keay, 2009;
Screen et al., 2011; Simmonds and Rudeva, 2012; Parkinson and Comiso, 2013; Simmonds and Rudeva, 2014). Cloud (Kapsch
et al., 2013), radiation (Kay and Gettelman, 2009; Choi et al., 2014) and precipitation (Boisvert et al., 2018; Wang
et al., 2019; Marcovecchio et al., 2021) are the important thermodynamic factors controlling Arctic sea ice trends
and variability. On the other hand, sea ice decline in turn exerts large influence on the atmosphere, including
cloud (Kay and Gettelman, 2009; Morrison et al., 2018), surface energy budget (Semmler et al., 2012; Boisvert et al.,
2015; Boisvert and Stroeve, 2015), precipitation (Bintanja and Selten, 2014; Kopec et al., 2016) and large-scale
circulation (Chemke et al., 2019; Kennel and Yulaeva, 2020). Figure 1 depicts the causal relations between key
atmospheric variables and sea ice over the Arctic. The sea ice here represents sea ice coverage and/or sea ice
thickness. Note that the processes a âˆ’ d are well-known atmospheric processes, including cloud microphysics,
thermodynamics, radiation, climate dynamics, which have been studied over the past few decades. The processes
e âˆ’ i are summarized from more recent publications, which are still under investigation by climate scientists.
We will explain processes e âˆ’ i in details in the next paragraph. The arrow e represents the two-way effect between
sea ice and net longwave flux at the surface. Based on global reanalysis (Kapsch et al., 2013; Lee et al., 2017),
surface (Cox et al., 2016) and satellite observations (Huang et al., 2017), as well as model simulations (Kapsch et
al., 2016; Huang et al., 2019a), the downward longwave radiation at the surface dominates surface warming and
therefore enhances sea ice melt in winter and spring. The increase in downward longwave flux is a result of an
increase in cloudiness and moisture in the Arctic Basin, which is caused by enhanced local evaporation or moisture
transport from mid-latitudes (Luo et al., 2017). Positive anomalies of longwave flux in spring and early summer
initiate an earlier melt onset, thereby triggering several feedback mechanisms which amplify melt during the
succeeding months (Kapsch et al., 2016; Huang et al., 2019b). The sea ice melt increases the air temperature

atmospheric processes with changes in Arctic sea ice. Therefore, in this study, we target to provide a more
comprehensive analysis about causality between multiple atmospheric processes and sea ice by applying different
data-driven causality approaches.

(arrows h, b). Among these studies, very few of them have demonstrated the delayed impact of one variable on another.
Specifically, the net shortwave flux at the surface in early summer (Mayâ€“July) is found to enhance sea ice melt with a
lag of 1â€“4 months (Choi et al., 2014). Moreover, the sea ice condition exhibits the delayed impacts on itself, which is
called sea ice anomaly persistence (Guemas et al., 2016; Cruz-GarcÃ­a et al., 2019; Holland et al., 2019). The sea ice
anomaly persistence depends on the predictand (area, extent, volume), region, and the initial and target dates, which
can be varied from a few days to a few years (Guemas et al., 2016). With sea ice anomaly persistence,
there is predictability for the sea ice area in winter but low predictability throughout the rest of the year in
peripheral seas. Based on multiple model simulations, the Labrador Sea stands out among the considered regions,
with sea ice predictability extending up to 1.5 years (Cruz-GarcÃ­a et al., 2019). Note that most of studies mentioned
above determine the changes in one variable, happening before another one, by applying time series analysis and/or
composite analysis based on observations, reanalysis or model output (Perovich et al., 2002; Sturm et al., 2002; Kay
and Gettelman, 2009; Wang et al., 2009; Nussbaumer and Pinker, 2012; Kapsch et al., 2013; Choi et al., 2014; Boisvert

2018; Wang et al., 2019). Among them, some studies use more advanced statistical analysis such as empirical orthogonal
function (Watanabe et al., 2006; Overland and Wang, 2010) and self-organizing map (Kapsch et al., 2019; Rinke et al.,
2019). Other studies assess the causal links through targeted modeling experiments (Bintanja and Selten, 2014; Kapsch
et al., 2016; Ding et al., 2017; Huang et al., 2019a; Cruz-GarcÃ­a et al., 2019), in order to test whether a manipulation
of one variable has an impact on others. And most of the studies focus on relationships between only one or two

(Ding et al., 2017; Huang et al., 2021; Luo et al., 2021). On the other hand, the reduction in Arctic sea ice extent
and increase in open water area in late summer are found to directly contribute to a modification of large-scale

Huang et al. Arctic Sea Ice Causality Discovery circulation patterns in the following autumn through the additional
heat stored in the Arctic Ocean and released to the atmosphere during the autumn (Overland and Wang, 2010). The
increased 1,000â€“500 hPa thickness in autumn produce anomalous easterley zonal wind component (u-component), especially
over the north of Alaska and Canada. Moreover, a more meridional flow pattern associated with sea ice reduction have
an impact on the mid-latitude weather (Overland and Wang, 2010). These conclusions are mainly drawn from model
simulations (Watanabe et al., 2006; Rinke et al., 2019), reanalysis and observations (Wang et al., 2009; Overland and
Wang, 2010; Kapsch et al., 2019). In addition to radiation, the sensible plus latent heat flux also plays an important
role in the Arctic energy budget. The increase in the downward moisture flux triggers the melting of the sea ice in
spring (Boisvert et al., 2015; Boisvert and Stroeve, 2015; Marcovecchio et al., 2021). Earlier melt onset and loss of
sea ice in the spring enhance warming of the ice-free ocean surface, which in turn leads to an increase of evaporation
from the surface into the atmosphere in the autumn. This positive feedback between heat flux and sea ice, indicated
by arrow h, has been confirmed by satellite observations (Boisvert et al., 2015; Boisvert and Stroeve, 2015) and model
simulations (Huang et al., 2019a) during most months of the year. The arrow i represents the influence of precipitation
on Arctic sea ice variations. Specifically, the magnitude of precipitation accumulating over the sea ice pack largely
determines the depth of the snow layer, which modulates the rate of sea ice growth because of its highly insulating
properties (Sturm et al., 2002). The phase of the precipitation falling on the sea ice pack is also important. As rain,
it can melt, compact, and densify the snowpack, thus reducing the surface albedo and promoting sea ice melt (Perovich
et al., 2002).The recent snowfall decline in summer is essentially caused by changes in precipitation form (snow
turning to rain) with very little influence of decreases in total precipitation, which is a result of
lower-atmospheric warming. Then the loss of snow-on-ice results in a substantial decrease in the surface albedo over
the Arctic Ocean, causing additional surface ice melt by absorbing more solar radiation (Screen and Simmonds, 2012).

CAUSALITY BETWEEN ATMOSPHERIC PROCESSES AND ARCTIC SEA ICE VARIATIONS
Due to the two-way interactions between the atmosphere and sea ice, studying causality between them is a challenging but
important task, which makes it an area of high interest within polar climate community. The sea ice variations can be
caused by different dynamical and thermodynamical processes. Important dynamical processes include anomalous surface
wind (Spreen et al., 2011; Wu et al., 2012), regional atmospheric circulation patterns (Overland and Wang, 2010;
Screen et al., 2018; Rinke et al., 2019) and abnormal storm activities (Simmonds et al., 2008; Simmonds and Keay, 2009;
Screen et al., 2011; Simmonds and Rudeva, 2012; Parkinson and Comiso, 2013; Simmonds and Rudeva, 2014). Cloud (Kapsch
et al., 2013), radiation (Kay and Gettelman, 2009; Choi et al., 2014) and precipitation (Boisvert et al., 2018; Wang
et al., 2019; Marcovecchio et al., 2021) are the important thermodynamic factors controlling Arctic sea ice trends
and variability. On the other hand, sea ice decline in turn exerts large influence on the atmosphere, including
cloud (Kay and Gettelman, 2009; Morrison et al., 2018), surface energy budget (Semmler et al., 2012; Boisvert et al.,
2015; Boisvert and Stroeve, 2015), precipitation (Bintanja and Selten, 2014; Kopec et al., 2016) and large-scale
circulation (Chemke et al., 2019; Kennel and Yulaeva, 2020). Figure 1 depicts the causal relations between key
atmospheric variables and sea ice over the Arctic. The sea ice here represents sea ice coverage and/or sea ice
thickness. Note that the processes a âˆ’ d are well-known atmospheric processes, including cloud microphysics,
thermodynamics, radiation, climate dynamics, which have been studied over the past few decades. The processes
e âˆ’ i are summarized from more recent publications, which are still under investigation by climate scientists.
We will explain processes e âˆ’ i in details in the next paragraph. The arrow e represents the two-way effect between
sea ice and net longwave flux at the surface. Based on global reanalysis (Kapsch et al., 2013; Lee et al., 2017),
surface (Cox et al., 2016) and satellite observations (Huang et al., 2017), as well as model simulations (Kapsch et
al., 2016; Huang et al., 2019a), the downward longwave radiation at the surface dominates surface warming and
therefore enhances sea ice melt in winter and spring. The increase in downward longwave flux is a result of an
increase in cloudiness and moisture in the Arctic Basin, which is caused by enhanced local evaporation or moisture
transport from mid-latitudes (Luo et al., 2017). Positive anomalies of longwave flux in spring and early summer
initiate an earlier melt onset, thereby triggering several feedback mechanisms which amplify melt during the
succeeding months (Kapsch et al., 2016; Huang et al., 2019b). The sea ice melt increases the air temperature

atmospheric processes with changes in Arctic sea ice. Therefore, in this study, we target to provide a more
comprehensive analysis about causality between multiple atmospheric processes and sea ice by applying different
data-driven causality approaches.

Huang et al. Arctic Sea Ice Causality Discovery surface. The downward shortwave flux, however, appears only
important after the melt has started (Kapsch et al., 2013; Huang et al., 2017). Once the surface albedo is
significantly reduced due to sea ice melt, the solar radiation could be absorbed by ocean, which further
accelerates ice melt in late spring and summer (Kay and Gettelman, 2009; Choi et al., 2014; Kapsch et al., 2016).
The feedback between surface net shortwave flux and sea ice, represented by arrow f in Figure 1, has been
confirmed by both model simulations (Kapsch et al., 2016) and satellite observations (Kay and Gettelman, 2009;
Nussbaumer and Pinker, 2012; Choi et al., 2014). The arrows g indicate the interactions between the sea ice variations
and atmospheric dynamical processes. A series of studies demonstrated that recent loss of Arctic sea ice is triggered
by the atmospheric circulation changes such as a tendency toward a dipole pattern in the mean sea level pressure trend
with an increase over the Arctic Ocean and a decrease over Siberia. The Arctic dipole anomaly in summer
(Wang et al., 2009), winter (Watanabe et al., 2006) and spring (Kapsch et al., 2019) produces a strong meridional
wind (v-component) anomaly that drives more sea ice out of the Arctic Ocean. In addition, this dipole anomaly promotes
transport of heat and moisture and thus enhances downward longwave radiation and control the melt onset
(Huang et al., 2019b; Kapsch et al., 2019). Moreover, the changes in cyclone occurrence and/or depth during spring
(Screen et al., 2011) and summer (Simmonds and Rudeva, 2012) have preconditioning effects on the sea ice cover and
exert a strong influence on the amount of sea ice that survives the melt season. A recent study also pointed out that
a stronger anticyclonic circulation over Greenland and the Arctic Ocean in the troposphere may have contributed as much
as 60% to the September sea ice extent decline since 1979, by warming and moistening the lower atmosphere

These conclusions are mainly drawn from in-situ measurements during field campaign (Perovich et al., 2002; Sturm et al.,
2002), global reanalysis products and surface observations (Screen and Simmonds, 2012; Boisvert et al., 2018;
Wang et al., 2019). The higher precipitation and snowfall could result in a thicker snowpack that allows less heat
loss to the atmosphere. More importantly, modeling studies suggest that increases in Arctic precipitation over the
21st century, particularly in late autumn and winter, are due mainly to strongly intensified local surface evaporation
(latent heat flux) (Bintanja and Selten, 2014). Therefore, we believe that Arctic precipitation exerts direct influence
on sea ice variations (arrow i), while sea ice modulates precipitation mainly through sensible plus latent heat flux

heat stored in the Arctic Ocean and released to the atmosphere during the autumn (Overland and Wang, 2010). The
increased 1,000â€“500 hPa thickness in autumn produce anomalous easterley zonal wind component (u-component), especially
over the north of Alaska and Canada. Moreover, a more meridional flow pattern associated with sea ice reduction have
an impact on the mid-latitude weather (Overland and Wang, 2010). These conclusions are mainly drawn from model
simulations (Watanabe et al., 2006; Rinke et al., 2019), reanalysis and observations (Wang et al., 2009; Overland and
Wang, 2010; Kapsch et al., 2019). In addition to radiation, the sensible plus latent heat flux also plays an important
role in the Arctic energy budget. The increase in the downward moisture flux triggers the melting of the sea ice in
spring (Boisvert et al., 2015; Boisvert and Stroeve, 2015; Marcovecchio et al., 2021). Earlier melt onset and loss of
sea ice in the spring enhance warming of the ice-free ocean surface, which in turn leads to an increase of evaporation
from the surface into the atmosphere in the autumn. This positive feedback between heat flux and sea ice, indicated
by arrow h, has been confirmed by satellite observations (Boisvert et al., 2015; Boisvert and Stroeve, 2015) and model
simulations (Huang et al., 2019a) during most months of the year. The arrow i represents the influence of precipitation
on Arctic sea ice variations. Specifically, the magnitude of precipitation accumulating over the sea ice pack largely
determines the depth of the snow layer, which modulates the rate of sea ice growth because of its highly insulating
properties (Sturm et al., 2002). The phase of the precipitation falling on the sea ice pack is also important. As rain,
it can melt, compact, and densify the snowpack, thus reducing the surface albedo and promoting sea ice melt (Perovich
et al., 2002).The recent snowfall decline in summer is essentially caused by changes in precipitation form (snow
turning to rain) with very little influence of decreases in total precipitation, which is a result of
lower-atmospheric warming. Then the loss of snow-on-ice results in a substantial decrease in the surface albedo over
the Arctic Ocean, causing additional surface ice melt by absorbing more solar radiation (Screen and Simmonds, 2012).

CAUSALITY BETWEEN ATMOSPHERIC PROCESSES AND ARCTIC SEA ICE VARIATIONS
Due to the two-way interactions between the atmosphere and sea ice, studying causality between them is a challenging but
important task, which makes it an area of high interest within polar climate community. The sea ice variations can be
caused by different dynamical and thermodynamical processes. Important dynamical processes include anomalous surface
wind (Spreen et al., 2011; Wu et al., 2012), regional atmospheric circulation patterns (Overland and Wang, 2010;
Screen et al., 2018; Rinke et al., 2019) and abnormal storm activities (Simmonds et al., 2008; Simmonds and Keay, 2009;
Screen et al., 2011; Simmonds and Rudeva, 2012; Parkinson and Comiso, 2013; Simmonds and Rudeva, 2014). Cloud (Kapsch
et al., 2013), radiation (Kay and Gettelman, 2009; Choi et al., 2014) and precipitation (Boisvert et al., 2018; Wang
et al., 2019; Marcovecchio et al., 2021) are the important thermodynamic factors controlling Arctic sea ice trends
and variability. On the other hand, sea ice decline in turn exerts large influence on the atmosphere, including
cloud (Kay and Gettelman, 2009; Morrison et al., 2018), surface energy budget (Semmler et al., 2012; Boisvert et al.,
2015; Boisvert and Stroeve, 2015), precipitation (Bintanja and Selten, 2014; Kopec et al., 2016) and large-scale
circulation (Chemke et al., 2019; Kennel and Yulaeva, 2020). Figure 1 depicts the causal relations between key
atmospheric variables and sea ice over the Arctic. The sea ice here represents sea ice coverage and/or sea ice
thickness. Note that the processes a âˆ’ d are well-known atmospheric processes, including cloud microphysics,
thermodynamics, radiation, climate dynamics, which have been studied over the past few decades. The processes
e âˆ’ i are summarized from more recent publications, which are still under investigation by climate scientists.
We will explain processes e âˆ’ i in details in the next paragraph. The arrow e represents the two-way effect between
sea ice and net longwave flux at the surface. Based on global reanalysis (Kapsch et al., 2013; Lee et al., 2017),
surface (Cox et al., 2016) and satellite observations (Huang et al., 2017), as well as model simulations (Kapsch et
al., 2016; Huang et al., 2019a), the downward longwave radiation at the surface dominates surface warming and
therefore enhances sea ice melt in winter and spring. The increase in downward longwave flux is a result of an
increase in cloudiness and moisture in the Arctic Basin, which is caused by enhanced local evaporation or moisture
transport from mid-latitudes (Luo et al., 2017). Positive anomalies of longwave flux in spring and early summer
initiate an earlier melt onset, thereby triggering several feedback mechanisms which amplify melt during the
succeeding months (Kapsch et al., 2016; Huang et al., 2019b). The sea ice melt increases the air temperature

atmospheric processes with changes in Arctic sea ice. Therefore, in this study, we target to provide a more
comprehensive analysis about causality between multiple atmospheric processes and sea ice by applying different
data-driven causality approaches.

Huang et al. Arctic Sea Ice Causality Discovery surface. The downward shortwave flux, however, appears only
important after the melt has started (Kapsch et al., 2013; Huang et al., 2017). Once the surface albedo is
significantly reduced due to sea ice melt, the solar radiation could be absorbed by ocean, which further
accelerates ice melt in late spring and summer (Kay and Gettelman, 2009; Choi et al., 2014; Kapsch et al., 2016).
The feedback between surface net shortwave flux and sea ice, represented by arrow f in Figure 1, has been
confirmed by both model simulations (Kapsch et al., 2016) and satellite observations (Kay and Gettelman, 2009;
Nussbaumer and Pinker, 2012; Choi et al., 2014). The arrows g indicate the interactions between the sea ice variations
and atmospheric dynamical processes. A series of studies demonstrated that recent loss of Arctic sea ice is triggered
by the atmospheric circulation changes such as a tendency toward a dipole pattern in the mean sea level pressure trend
with an increase over the Arctic Ocean and a decrease over Siberia. The Arctic dipole anomaly in summer
(Wang et al., 2009), winter (Watanabe et al., 2006) and spring (Kapsch et al., 2019) produces a strong meridional
wind (v-component) anomaly that drives more sea ice out of the Arctic Ocean. In addition, this dipole anomaly promotes
transport of heat and moisture and thus enhances downward longwave radiation and control the melt onset
(Huang et al., 2019b; Kapsch et al., 2019). Moreover, the changes in cyclone occurrence and/or depth during spring
(Screen et al., 2011) and summer (Simmonds and Rudeva, 2012) have preconditioning effects on the sea ice cover and
exert a strong influence on the amount of sea ice that survives the melt season. A recent study also pointed out that
a stronger anticyclonic circulation over Greenland and the Arctic Ocean in the troposphere may have contributed as much
as 60% to the September sea ice extent decline since 1979, by warming and moistening the lower atmosphere

These conclusions are mainly drawn from in-situ measurements during field campaign (Perovich et al., 2002; Sturm et al.,
2002), global reanalysis products and surface observations (Screen and Simmonds, 2012; Boisvert et al., 2018;
Wang et al., 2019). The higher precipitation and snowfall could result in a thicker snowpack that allows less heat
loss to the atmosphere. More importantly, modeling studies suggest that increases in Arctic precipitation over the
21st century, particularly in late autumn and winter, are due mainly to strongly intensified local surface evaporation
(latent heat flux) (Bintanja and Selten, 2014). Therefore, we believe that Arctic precipitation exerts direct influence
on sea ice variations (arrow i), while sea ice modulates precipitation mainly through sensible plus latent heat flux
(arrows h, b). Among these studies, very few of them have demonstrated the delayed impact of one variable on another.
Specifically, the net shortwave flux at the surface in early summer (Mayâ€“July) is found to enhance sea ice melt with a
lag of 1â€“4 months (Choi et al., 2014). Moreover, the sea ice condition exhibits the delayed impacts on itself, which is
called sea ice anomaly persistence (Guemas et al., 2016; Cruz-GarcÃ­a et al., 2019; Holland et al., 2019). The sea ice
anomaly persistence depends on the predictand (area, extent, volume), region, and the initial and target dates, which
can be varied from a few days to a few years (Guemas et al., 2016). With sea ice anomaly persistence,
there is predictability for the sea ice area in winter but low predictability throughout the rest of the year in
peripheral seas. Based on multiple model simulations, the Labrador Sea stands out among the considered regions,
with sea ice predictability extending up to 1.5 years (Cruz-GarcÃ­a et al., 2019). Note that most of studies mentioned
above determine the changes in one variable, happening before another one, by applying time series analysis and/or
composite analysis based on observations, reanalysis or model output (Perovich et al., 2002; Sturm et al., 2002; Kay
and Gettelman, 2009; Wang et al., 2009; Nussbaumer and Pinker, 2012; Kapsch et al., 2013; Choi et al., 2014; Boisvert

2018; Wang et al., 2019). Among them, some studies use more advanced statistical analysis such as empirical orthogonal
function (Watanabe et al., 2006; Overland and Wang, 2010) and self-organizing map (Kapsch et al., 2019; Rinke et al.,
2019). Other studies assess the causal links through targeted modeling experiments (Bintanja and Selten, 2014; Kapsch
et al., 2016; Ding et al., 2017; Huang et al., 2019a; Cruz-GarcÃ­a et al., 2019), in order to test whether a manipulation
of one variable has an impact on others. And most of the studies focus on relationships between only one or two

(Ding et al., 2017; Huang et al., 2021; Luo et al., 2021). On the other hand, the reduction in Arctic sea ice extent
and increase in open water area in late summer are found to directly contribute to a modification of large-scale

et al., 2019; Marcovecchio et al., 2021) are the important thermodynamic factors controlling Arctic sea ice trends
and variability. On the other hand, sea ice decline in turn exerts large influence on the atmosphere, including
cloud (Kay and Gettelman, 2009; Morrison et al., 2018), surface energy budget (Semmler et al., 2012; Boisvert et al.,

surface (Cox et al., 2016) and satellite observations (Huang et al., 2017), as well as model simulations (Kapsch et
al., 2016; Huang et al., 2019a), the downward longwave radiation at the surface dominates surface warming and
therefore enhances sea ice melt in winter and spring. The increase in downward longwave flux is a result of an
increase in cloudiness and moisture in the Arctic Basin, which is caused by enhanced local evaporation or moisture
transport from mid-latitudes (Luo et al., 2017). Positive anomalies of longwave flux in spring and early summer
initiate an earlier melt onset, thereby triggering several feedback mechanisms which amplify melt during the
succeeding months (Kapsch et al., 2016; Huang et al., 2019b). The sea ice melt increases the air temperature

Huang et al. Arctic Sea Ice Causality Discovery surface. The downward shortwave flux, however, appears only
important after the melt has started (Kapsch et al., 2013; Huang et al., 2017). Once the surface albedo is
significantly reduced due to sea ice melt, the solar radiation could be absorbed by ocean, which further
accelerates ice melt in late spring and summer (Kay and Gettelman, 2009; Choi et al., 2014; Kapsch et al., 2016).
The feedback between surface net shortwave flux and sea ice, represented by arrow f in Figure 1, has been
confirmed by both model simulations (Kapsch et al., 2016) and satellite observations (Kay and Gettelman, 2009;
Nussbaumer and Pinker, 2012; Choi et al., 2014). The arrows g indicate the interactions between the sea ice variations
and atmospheric dynamical processes. A series of studies demonstrated that recent loss of Arctic sea ice is triggered
by the atmospheric circulation changes such as a tendency toward a dipole pattern in the mean sea level pressure trend
with an increase over the Arctic Ocean and a decrease over Siberia. The Arctic dipole anomaly in summer
(Wang et al., 2009), winter (Watanabe et al., 2006) and spring (Kapsch et al., 2019) produces a strong meridional
wind (v-component) anomaly that drives more sea ice out of the Arctic Ocean. In addition, this dipole anomaly promotes
transport of heat and moisture and thus enhances downward longwave radiation and control the melt onset
(Huang et al., 2019b; Kapsch et al., 2019). Moreover, the changes in cyclone occurrence and/or depth during spring
(Screen et al., 2011) and summer (Simmonds and Rudeva, 2012) have preconditioning effects on the sea ice cover and
exert a strong influence on the amount of sea ice that survives the melt season. A recent study also pointed out that
a stronger anticyclonic circulation over Greenland and the Arctic Ocean in the troposphere may have contributed as much
as 60% to the September sea ice extent decline since 1979, by warming and moistening the lower atmosphere

These conclusions are mainly drawn from in-situ measurements during field campaign (Perovich et al., 2002; Sturm et al.,
2002), global reanalysis products and surface observations (Screen and Simmonds, 2012; Boisvert et al., 2018;
Wang et al., 2019). The higher precipitation and snowfall could result in a thicker snowpack that allows less heat
loss to the atmosphere. More importantly, modeling studies suggest that increases in Arctic precipitation over the
21st century, particularly in late autumn and winter, are due mainly to strongly intensified local surface evaporation
(latent heat flux) (Bintanja and Selten, 2014). Therefore, we believe that Arctic precipitation exerts direct influence
on sea ice variations (arrow i), while sea ice modulates precipitation mainly through sensible plus latent heat flux
(arrows h, b). Among these studies, very few of them have demonstrated the delayed impact of one variable on another.
Specifically, the net shortwave flux at the surface in early summer (Mayâ€“July) is found to enhance sea ice melt with a
lag of 1â€“4 months (Choi et al., 2014). Moreover, the sea ice condition exhibits the delayed impacts on itself, which is
called sea ice anomaly persistence (Guemas et al., 2016; Cruz-GarcÃ­a et al., 2019; Holland et al., 2019). The sea ice
anomaly persistence depends on the predictand (area, extent, volume), region, and the initial and target dates, which
can be varied from a few days to a few years (Guemas et al., 2016). With sea ice anomaly persistence,
there is predictability for the sea ice area in winter but low predictability throughout the rest of the year in
peripheral seas. Based on multiple model simulations, the Labrador Sea stands out among the considered regions,
with sea ice predictability extending up to 1.5 years (Cruz-GarcÃ­a et al., 2019). Note that most of studies mentioned
above determine the changes in one variable, happening before another one, by applying time series analysis and/or
composite analysis based on observations, reanalysis or model output (Perovich et al., 2002; Sturm et al., 2002; Kay
and Gettelman, 2009; Wang et al., 2009; Nussbaumer and Pinker, 2012; Kapsch et al., 2013; Choi et al., 2014; Boisvert
et al., 2015; Boisvert and Stroeve, 2015; Cox et al., 2016; Huang et al., 2017; Huang et al., 2019b; Boisvert et al.,
2018; Wang et al., 2019). Among them, some studies use more advanced statistical analysis such as empirical orthogonal
function (Watanabe et al., 2006; Overland and Wang, 2010) and self-organizing map (Kapsch et al., 2019; Rinke et al.,
2019). Other studies assess the causal links through targeted modeling experiments (Bintanja and Selten, 2014; Kapsch
et al., 2016; Ding et al., 2017; Huang et al., 2019a; Cruz-GarcÃ­a et al., 2019), in order to test whether a manipulation
of one variable has an impact on others. And most of the studies focus on relationships between only one or two

(Ding et al., 2017; Huang et al., 2021; Luo et al., 2021). On the other hand, the reduction in Arctic sea ice extent
and increase in open water area in late summer are found to directly contribute to a modification of large-scale

Huang et al. Arctic Sea Ice Causality Discovery circulation patterns in the following autumn through the additional
heat stored in the Arctic Ocean and released to the atmosphere during the autumn (Overland and Wang, 2010). The
increased 1,000â€“500 hPa thickness in autumn produce anomalous easterley zonal wind component (u-component), especially
over the north of Alaska and Canada. Moreover, a more meridional flow pattern associated with sea ice reduction have
an impact on the mid-latitude weather (Overland and Wang, 2010). These conclusions are mainly drawn from model
simulations (Watanabe et al., 2006; Rinke et al., 2019), reanalysis and observations (Wang et al., 2009; Overland and
Wang, 2010; Kapsch et al., 2019). In addition to radiation, the sensible plus latent heat flux also plays an important
role in the Arctic energy budget. The increase in the downward moisture flux triggers the melting of the sea ice in
spring (Boisvert et al., 2015; Boisvert and Stroeve, 2015; Marcovecchio et al., 2021). Earlier melt onset and loss of
sea ice in the spring enhance warming of the ice-free ocean surface, which in turn leads to an increase of evaporation
from the surface into the atmosphere in the autumn. This positive feedback between heat flux and sea ice, indicated
by arrow h, has been confirmed by satellite observations (Boisvert et al., 2015; Boisvert and Stroeve, 2015) and model
simulations (Huang et al., 2019a) during most months of the year. The arrow i represents the influence of precipitation
on Arctic sea ice variations. Specifically, the magnitude of precipitation accumulating over the sea ice pack largely
determines the depth of the snow layer, which modulates the rate of sea ice growth because of its highly insulating
properties (Sturm et al., 2002). The phase of the precipitation falling on the sea ice pack is also important. As rain,
it can melt, compact, and densify the snowpack, thus reducing the surface albedo and promoting sea ice melt (Perovich
et al., 2002).The recent snowfall decline in summer is essentially caused by changes in precipitation form (snow
turning to rain) with very little influence of decreases in total precipitation, which is a result of
lower-atmospheric warming. Then the loss of snow-on-ice results in a substantial decrease in the surface albedo over
the Arctic Ocean, causing additional surface ice melt by absorbing more solar radiation (Screen and Simmonds, 2012).

CAUSALITY BETWEEN ATMOSPHERIC PROCESSES AND ARCTIC SEA ICE VARIATIONS
Due to the two-way interactions between the atmosphere and sea ice, studying causality between them is a challenging but
important task, which makes it an area of high interest within polar climate community. The sea ice variations can be
caused by different dynamical and thermodynamical processes. Important dynamical processes include anomalous surface
wind (Spreen et al., 2011; Wu et al., 2012), regional atmospheric circulation patterns (Overland and Wang, 2010;
Screen et al., 2018; Rinke et al., 2019) and abnormal storm activities (Simmonds et al., 2008; Simmonds and Keay, 2009;
Screen et al., 2011; Simmonds and Rudeva, 2012; Parkinson and Comiso, 2013; Simmonds and Rudeva, 2014). Cloud (Kapsch
et al., 2013), radiation (Kay and Gettelman, 2009; Choi et al., 2014) and precipitation (Boisvert et al., 2018; Wang

Huang et al. Arctic Sea Ice Causality Discovery surface. The downward shortwave flux, however, appears only
important after the melt has started (Kapsch et al., 2013; Huang et al., 2017). Once the surface albedo is
significantly reduced due to sea ice melt, the solar radiation could be absorbed by ocean, which further
accelerates ice melt in late spring and summer (Kay and Gettelman, 2009; Choi et al., 2014; Kapsch et al., 2016).
The feedback between surface net shortwave flux and sea ice, represented by arrow f in Figure 1, has been
confirmed by both model simulations (Kapsch et al., 2016) and satellite observations (Kay and Gettelman, 2009;
Nussbaumer and Pinker, 2012; Choi et al., 2014). The arrows g indicate the interactions between the sea ice variations
and atmospheric dynamical processes. A series of studies demonstrated that recent loss of Arctic sea ice is triggered
by the atmospheric circulation changes such as a tendency toward a dipole pattern in the mean sea level pressure trend
with an increase over the Arctic Ocean and a decrease over Siberia. The Arctic dipole anomaly in summer
(Wang et al., 2009), winter (Watanabe et al., 2006) and spring (Kapsch et al., 2019) produces a strong meridional
wind (v-component) anomaly that drives more sea ice out of the Arctic Ocean. In addition, this dipole anomaly promotes
transport of heat and moisture and thus enhances downward longwave radiation and control the melt onset
(Huang et al., 2019b; Kapsch et al., 2019). Moreover, the changes in cyclone occurrence and/or depth during spring
(Screen et al., 2011) and summer (Simmonds and Rudeva, 2012) have preconditioning effects on the sea ice cover and
exert a strong influence on the amount of sea ice that survives the melt season. A recent study also pointed out that
a stronger anticyclonic circulation over Greenland and the Arctic Ocean in the troposphere may have contributed as much
as 60% to the September sea ice extent decline since 1979, by warming and moistening the lower atmosphere

These conclusions are mainly drawn from in-situ measurements during field campaign (Perovich et al., 2002; Sturm et al.,
2002), global reanalysis products and surface observations (Screen and Simmonds, 2012; Boisvert et al., 2018;
Wang et al., 2019). The higher precipitation and snowfall could result in a thicker snowpack that allows less heat
loss to the atmosphere. More importantly, modeling studies suggest that increases in Arctic precipitation over the
21st century, particularly in late autumn and winter, are due mainly to strongly intensified local surface evaporation
(latent heat flux) (Bintanja and Selten, 2014). Therefore, we believe that Arctic precipitation exerts direct influence
on sea ice variations (arrow i), while sea ice modulates precipitation mainly through sensible plus latent heat flux
(arrows h, b). Among these studies, very few of them have demonstrated the delayed impact of one variable on another.
Specifically, the net shortwave flux at the surface in early summer (Mayâ€“July) is found to enhance sea ice melt with a
lag of 1â€“4 months (Choi et al., 2014). Moreover, the sea ice condition exhibits the delayed impacts on itself, which is
called sea ice anomaly persistence (Guemas et al., 2016; Cruz-GarcÃ­a et al., 2019; Holland et al., 2019). The sea ice
anomaly persistence depends on the predictand (area, extent, volume), region, and the initial and target dates, which
can be varied from a few days to a few years (Guemas et al., 2016). With sea ice anomaly persistence,
there is predictability for the sea ice area in winter but low predictability throughout the rest of the year in
peripheral seas. Based on multiple model simulations, the Labrador Sea stands out among the considered regions,
with sea ice predictability extending up to 1.5 years (Cruz-GarcÃ­a et al., 2019). Note that most of studies mentioned
above determine the changes in one variable, happening before another one, by applying time series analysis and/or
composite analysis based on observations, reanalysis or model output (Perovich et al., 2002; Sturm et al., 2002; Kay
and Gettelman, 2009; Wang et al., 2009; Nussbaumer and Pinker, 2012; Kapsch et al., 2013; Choi et al., 2014; Boisvert

2018; Wang et al., 2019). Among them, some studies use more advanced statistical analysis such as empirical orthogonal
function (Watanabe et al., 2006; Overland and Wang, 2010) and self-organizing map (Kapsch et al., 2019; Rinke et al.,
2019). Other studies assess the causal links through targeted modeling experiments (Bintanja and Selten, 2014; Kapsch
et al., 2016; Ding et al., 2017; Huang et al., 2019a; Cruz-GarcÃ­a et al., 2019), in order to test whether a manipulation
of one variable has an impact on others. And most of the studies focus on relationships between only one or two

(Ding et al., 2017; Huang et al., 2021; Luo et al., 2021). On the other hand, the reduction in Arctic sea ice extent
and increase in open water area in late summer are found to directly contribute to a modification of large-scale

Huang et al. Arctic Sea Ice Causality Discovery circulation patterns in the following autumn through the additional
heat stored in the Arctic Ocean and released to the atmosphere during the autumn (Overland and Wang, 2010). The
increased 1,000â€“500 hPa thickness in autumn produce anomalous easterley zonal wind component (u-component), especially
over the north of Alaska and Canada. Moreover, a more meridional flow pattern associated with sea ice reduction have
an impact on the mid-latitude weather (Overland and Wang, 2010). These conclusions are mainly drawn from model
simulations (Watanabe et al., 2006; Rinke et al., 2019), reanalysis and observations (Wang et al., 2009; Overland and
Wang, 2010; Kapsch et al., 2019). In addition to radiation, the sensible plus latent heat flux also plays an important
role in the Arctic energy budget. The increase in the downward moisture flux triggers the melting of the sea ice in
spring (Boisvert et al., 2015; Boisvert and Stroeve, 2015; Marcovecchio et al., 2021). Earlier melt onset and loss of
sea ice in the spring enhance warming of the ice-free ocean surface, which in turn leads to an increase of evaporation
from the surface into the atmosphere in the autumn. This positive feedback between heat flux and sea ice, indicated
by arrow h, has been confirmed by satellite observations (Boisvert et al., 2015; Boisvert and Stroeve, 2015) and model
simulations (Huang et al., 2019a) during most months of the year. The arrow i represents the influence of precipitation
on Arctic sea ice variations. Specifically, the magnitude of precipitation accumulating over the sea ice pack largely
determines the depth of the snow layer, which modulates the rate of sea ice growth because of its highly insulating
properties (Sturm et al., 2002). The phase of the precipitation falling on the sea ice pack is also important. As rain,
it can melt, compact, and densify the snowpack, thus reducing the surface albedo and promoting sea ice melt (Perovich
et al., 2002).The recent snowfall decline in summer is essentially caused by changes in precipitation form (snow
turning to rain) with very little influence of decreases in total precipitation, which is a result of
lower-atmospheric warming. Then the loss of snow-on-ice results in a substantial decrease in the surface albedo over
the Arctic Ocean, causing additional surface ice melt by absorbing more solar radiation (Screen and Simmonds, 2012).

CAUSALITY BETWEEN ATMOSPHERIC PROCESSES AND ARCTIC SEA ICE VARIATIONS
Due to the two-way interactions between the atmosphere and sea ice, studying causality between them is a challenging but
important task, which makes it an area of high interest within polar climate community. The sea ice variations can be
caused by different dynamical and thermodynamical processes. Important dynamical processes include anomalous surface
wind (Spreen et al., 2011; Wu et al., 2012), regional atmospheric circulation patterns (Overland and Wang, 2010;
Screen et al., 2018; Rinke et al., 2019) and abnormal storm activities (Simmonds et al., 2008; Simmonds and Keay, 2009;
Screen et al., 2011; Simmonds and Rudeva, 2012; Parkinson and Comiso, 2013; Simmonds and Rudeva, 2014). Cloud (Kapsch
et al., 2013), radiation (Kay and Gettelman, 2009; Choi et al., 2014) and precipitation (Boisvert et al., 2018; Wang
et al., 2019; Marcovecchio et al., 2021) are the important thermodynamic factors controlling Arctic sea ice trends
and variability. On the other hand, sea ice decline in turn exerts large influence on the atmosphere, including
cloud (Kay and Gettelman, 2009; Morrison et al., 2018), surface energy budget (Semmler et al., 2012; Boisvert et al.,
2015; Boisvert and Stroeve, 2015), precipitation (Bintanja and Selten, 2014; Kopec et al., 2016) and large-scale
circulation (Chemke et al., 2019; Kennel and Yulaeva, 2020). Figure 1 depicts the causal relations between key
atmospheric variables and sea ice over the Arctic. The sea ice here represents sea ice coverage and/or sea ice
thickness. Note that the processes a âˆ’ d are well-known atmospheric processes, including cloud microphysics,
thermodynamics, radiation, climate dynamics, which have been studied over the past few decades. The processes
e âˆ’ i are summarized from more recent publications, which are still under investigation by climate scientists.
We will explain processes e âˆ’ i in details in the next paragraph. The arrow e represents the two-way effect between
sea ice and net longwave flux at the surface. Based on global reanalysis (Kapsch et al., 2013; Lee et al., 2017),
surface (Cox et al., 2016) and satellite observations (Huang et al., 2017), as well as model simulations (Kapsch et
al., 2016; Huang et al., 2019a), the downward longwave radiation at the surface dominates surface warming and
therefore enhances sea ice melt in winter and spring. The increase in downward longwave flux is a result of an
increase in cloudiness and moisture in the Arctic Basin, which is caused by enhanced local evaporation or moisture
transport from mid-latitudes (Luo et al., 2017). Positive anomalies of longwave flux in spring and early summer
initiate an earlier melt onset, thereby triggering several feedback mechanisms which amplify melt during the
succeeding months (Kapsch et al., 2016; Huang et al., 2019b). The sea ice melt increases the air temperature

atmospheric processes with changes in Arctic sea ice. Therefore, in this study, we target to provide a more
comprehensive analysis about causality between multiple atmospheric processes and sea ice by applying different
data-driven causality approaches.

2002), global reanalysis products and surface observations (Screen and Simmonds, 2012; Boisvert et al., 2018;
Wang et al., 2019). The higher precipitation and snowfall could result in a thicker snowpack that allows less heat
loss to the atmosphere. More importantly, modeling studies suggest that increases in Arctic precipitation over the
21st century, particularly in late autumn and winter, are due mainly to strongly intensified local surface evaporation
(latent heat flux) (Bintanja and Selten, 2014). Therefore, we believe that Arctic precipitation exerts direct influence
on sea ice variations (arrow i), while sea ice modulates precipitation mainly through sensible plus latent heat flux
(arrows h, b). Among these studies, very few of them have demonstrated the delayed impact of one variable on another.
Specifically, the net shortwave flux at the surface in early summer (Mayâ€“July) is found to enhance sea ice melt with a
lag of 1â€“4 months (Choi et al., 2014). Moreover, the sea ice condition exhibits the delayed impacts on itself, which is
called sea ice anomaly persistence (Guemas et al., 2016; Cruz-GarcÃ­a et al., 2019; Holland et al., 2019). The sea ice
anomaly persistence depends on the predictand (area, extent, volume), region, and the initial and target dates, which
can be varied from a few days to a few years (Guemas et al., 2016). With sea ice anomaly persistence,
there is predictability for the sea ice area in winter but low predictability throughout the rest of the year in
peripheral seas. Based on multiple model simulations, the Labrador Sea stands out among the considered regions,
with sea ice predictability extending up to 1.5 years (Cruz-GarcÃ­a et al., 2019). Note that most of studies mentioned
above determine the changes in one variable, happening before another one, by applying time series analysis and/or
composite analysis based on observations, reanalysis or model output (Perovich et al., 2002; Sturm et al., 2002; Kay
and Gettelman, 2009; Wang et al., 2009; Nussbaumer and Pinker, 2012; Kapsch et al., 2013; Choi et al., 2014; Boisvert

2018; Wang et al., 2019). Among them, some studies use more advanced statistical analysis such as empirical orthogonal
function (Watanabe et al., 2006; Overland and Wang, 2010) and self-organizing map (Kapsch et al., 2019; Rinke et al.,
2019). Other studies assess the causal links through targeted modeling experiments (Bintanja and Selten, 2014; Kapsch
et al., 2016; Ding et al., 2017; Huang et al., 2019a; Cruz-GarcÃ­a et al., 2019), in order to test whether a manipulation
of one variable has an impact on others. And most of the studies focus on relationships between only one or two

(Ding et al., 2017; Huang et al., 2021; Luo et al., 2021). On the other hand, the reduction in Arctic sea ice extent
and increase in open water area in late summer are found to directly contribute to a modification of large-scale

Huang et al. Arctic Sea Ice Causality Discovery circulation patterns in the following autumn through the additional
heat stored in the Arctic Ocean and released to the atmosphere during the autumn (Overland and Wang, 2010). The
increased 1,000â€“500 hPa thickness in autumn produce anomalous easterley zonal wind component (u-component), especially
over the north of Alaska and Canada. Moreover, a more meridional flow pattern associated with sea ice reduction have
an impact on the mid-latitude weather (Overland and Wang, 2010). These conclusions are mainly drawn from model
simulations (Watanabe et al., 2006; Rinke et al., 2019), reanalysis and observations (Wang et al., 2009; Overland and
Wang, 2010; Kapsch et al., 2019). In addition to radiation, the sensible plus latent heat flux also plays an important
role in the Arctic energy budget. The increase in the downward moisture flux triggers the melting of the sea ice in
spring (Boisvert et al., 2015; Boisvert and Stroeve, 2015; Marcovecchio et al., 2021). Earlier melt onset and loss of
sea ice in the spring enhance warming of the ice-free ocean surface, which in turn leads to an increase of evaporation
from the surface into the atmosphere in the autumn. This positive feedback between heat flux and sea ice, indicated
by arrow h, has been confirmed by satellite observations (Boisvert et al., 2015; Boisvert and Stroeve, 2015) and model
simulations (Huang et al., 2019a) during most months of the year. The arrow i represents the influence of precipitation
on Arctic sea ice variations. Specifically, the magnitude of precipitation accumulating over the sea ice pack largely
determines the depth of the snow layer, which modulates the rate of sea ice growth because of its highly insulating
properties (Sturm et al., 2002). The phase of the precipitation falling on the sea ice pack is also important. As rain,
it can melt, compact, and densify the snowpack, thus reducing the surface albedo and promoting sea ice melt (Perovich
et al., 2002).The recent snowfall decline in summer is essentially caused by changes in precipitation form (snow
turning to rain) with very little influence of decreases in total precipitation, which is a result of
lower-atmospheric warming. Then the loss of snow-on-ice results in a substantial decrease in the surface albedo over
the Arctic Ocean, causing additional surface ice melt by absorbing more solar radiation (Screen and Simmonds, 2012).

CAUSALITY BETWEEN ATMOSPHERIC PROCESSES AND ARCTIC SEA ICE VARIATIONS
Due to the two-way interactions between the atmosphere and sea ice, studying causality between them is a challenging but
important task, which makes it an area of high interest within polar climate community. The sea ice variations can be
caused by different dynamical and thermodynamical processes. Important dynamical processes include anomalous surface
wind (Spreen et al., 2011; Wu et al., 2012), regional atmospheric circulation patterns (Overland and Wang, 2010;
Screen et al., 2018; Rinke et al., 2019) and abnormal storm activities (Simmonds et al., 2008; Simmonds and Keay, 2009;
Screen et al., 2011; Simmonds and Rudeva, 2012; Parkinson and Comiso, 2013; Simmonds and Rudeva, 2014). Cloud (Kapsch
et al., 2013), radiation (Kay and Gettelman, 2009; Choi et al., 2014) and precipitation (Boisvert et al., 2018; Wang
et al., 2019; Marcovecchio et al., 2021) are the important thermodynamic factors controlling Arctic sea ice trends
and variability. On the other hand, sea ice decline in turn exerts large influence on the atmosphere, including
cloud (Kay and Gettelman, 2009; Morrison et al., 2018), surface energy budget (Semmler et al., 2012; Boisvert et al.,
2015; Boisvert and Stroeve, 2015), precipitation (Bintanja and Selten, 2014; Kopec et al., 2016) and large-scale
circulation (Chemke et al., 2019; Kennel and Yulaeva, 2020). Figure 1 depicts the causal relations between key
atmospheric variables and sea ice over the Arctic. The sea ice here represents sea ice coverage and/or sea ice
thickness. Note that the processes a âˆ’ d are well-known atmospheric processes, including cloud microphysics,
thermodynamics, radiation, climate dynamics, which have been studied over the past few decades. The processes
e âˆ’ i are summarized from more recent publications, which are still under investigation by climate scientists.
We will explain processes e âˆ’ i in details in the next paragraph. The arrow e represents the two-way effect between
sea ice and net longwave flux at the surface. Based on global reanalysis (Kapsch et al., 2013; Lee et al., 2017),
surface (Cox et al., 2016) and satellite observations (Huang et al., 2017), as well as model simulations (Kapsch et
al., 2016; Huang et al., 2019a), the downward longwave radiation at the surface dominates surface warming and
therefore enhances sea ice melt in winter and spring. The increase in downward longwave flux is a result of an
increase in cloudiness and moisture in the Arctic Basin, which is caused by enhanced local evaporation or moisture
transport from mid-latitudes (Luo et al., 2017). Positive anomalies of longwave flux in spring and early summer
initiate an earlier melt onset, thereby triggering several feedback mechanisms which amplify melt during the
succeeding months (Kapsch et al., 2016; Huang et al., 2019b). The sea ice melt increases the air temperature

atmospheric processes with changes in Arctic sea ice. Therefore, in this study, we target to provide a more
comprehensive analysis about causality between multiple atmospheric processes and sea ice by applying different
data-driven causality approaches.

104,"Based on the provided context, the relationship between sea ice coverage and/or sea ice thickness (sea_ice) and total precipitation (Precip) can be summarized as follows:

1. Precipitation influences sea ice variations: The magnitude of precipitation accumulating over the sea ice pack largely determines the depth of the snow layer, which modulates the rate of sea ice growth due to its highly insulating properties. Rainfall on the sea ice pack can melt, compact, and densify the snowpack, reducing the surface albedo and promoting sea ice melt.

2. Sea ice modulates precipitation: Sea ice modulates precipitation mainly through sensible plus latent heat flux. Changes in sea ice conditions can affect the evaporation of moisture from the surface, which can influence precipitation patterns.

Based on this information, sea ice coverage and/or sea ice thickness (sea_ice) can be considered a contributing factor to total precipitation (Precip), but it is not a direct cause.

Huang et al. Arctic Sea Ice Causality Discovery surface. The downward shortwave flux, however, appears only
important after the melt has started (Kapsch et al., 2013; Huang et al., 2017). Once the surface albedo is
significantly reduced due to sea ice melt, the solar radiation could be absorbed by ocean, which further
accelerates ice melt in late spring and summer (Kay and Gettelman, 2009; Choi et al., 2014; Kapsch et al., 2016).
The feedback between surface net shortwave flux and sea ice, represented by arrow f in Figure 1, has been

Nussbaumer and Pinker, 2012; Choi et al., 2014). The arrows g indicate the interactions between the sea ice variations
and atmospheric dynamical processes. A series of studies demonstrated that recent loss of Arctic sea ice is triggered
by the atmospheric circulation changes such as a tendency toward a dipole pattern in the mean sea level pressure trend
with an increase over the Arctic Ocean and a decrease over Siberia. The Arctic dipole anomaly in summer
(Wang et al., 2009), winter (Watanabe et al., 2006) and spring (Kapsch et al., 2019) produces a strong meridional
wind (v-component) anomaly that drives more sea ice out of the Arctic Ocean. In addition, this dipole anomaly promotes
transport of heat and moisture and thus enhances downward longwave radiation and control the melt onset
(Huang et al., 2019b; Kapsch et al., 2019). Moreover, the changes in cyclone occurrence and/or depth during spring
(Screen et al., 2011) and summer (Simmonds and Rudeva, 2012) have preconditioning effects on the sea ice cover and
exert a strong influence on the amount of sea ice that survives the melt season. A recent study also pointed out that
a stronger anticyclonic circulation over Greenland and the Arctic Ocean in the troposphere may have contributed as much
as 60% to the September sea ice extent decline since 1979, by warming and moistening the lower atmosphere

These conclusions are mainly drawn from in-situ measurements during field campaign (Perovich et al., 2002; Sturm et al.,

According to the information provided, the causality graph between key atmospheric variables and sea ice over the Arctic indicates that there are multiple processes involved in the relationship between sea ice and RH. The processes e-i are summarized from recent peer-reviewed publications and are still under investigation by climate scientists.

The specific processes mentioned in the context that are relevant to sea ice and RH are as follows:

- Process e: Two-way effect between sea ice and net longwave flux at the surface. Downward longwave radiation at the surface enhances sea ice melt in winter and spring, which is caused by an increase in cloudiness and moisture in the Arctic Basin.
- Process h: Positive feedback between heat flux and sea ice. The increase in downward moisture flux triggers the melting of sea ice in spring, leading to earlier melt onset and loss of sea ice, which in turn increases evaporation from the surface into the atmosphere in autumn.
- Process i: Influence of precipitation on Arctic sea ice variations. The magnitude and phase of precipitation accumulating over the sea ice pack determine the depth of the snow layer, which modulates the rate of sea ice growth. Rainfall on the sea ice pack can melt and compact the snowpack, reducing surface albedo and promoting sea ice melt.

Huang et al. Arctic Sea Ice Causality Discovery circulation patterns in the following autumn through the additional
heat stored in the Arctic Ocean and released to the atmosphere during the autumn (Overland and Wang, 2010). The
increased 1,000â€“500 hPa thickness in autumn produce anomalous easterley zonal wind component (u-component), especially
over the north of Alaska and Canada. Moreover, a more meridional flow pattern associated with sea ice reduction have
an impact on the mid-latitude weather (Overland and Wang, 2010). These conclusions are mainly drawn from model
simulations (Watanabe et al., 2006; Rinke et al., 2019), reanalysis and observations (Wang et al., 2009; Overland and
Wang, 2010; Kapsch et al., 2019). In addition to radiation, the sensible plus latent heat flux also plays an important
role in the Arctic energy budget. The increase in the downward moisture flux triggers the melting of the sea ice in
spring (Boisvert et al., 2015; Boisvert and Stroeve, 2015; Marcovecchio et al., 2021). Earlier melt onset and loss of
sea ice in the spring enhance warming of the ice-free ocean surface, which in turn leads to an increase of evaporation
from the surface into the atmosphere in the autumn. This positive feedback between heat flux and sea ice, indicated
by arrow h, has been confirmed by satellite observations (Boisvert et al., 2015; Boisvert and Stroeve, 2015) and model
simulations (Huang et al., 2019a) during most months of the year. The arrow i represents the influence of precipitation
on Arctic sea ice variations. Specifically, the magnitude of precipitation accumulating over the sea ice pack largely
determines the depth of the snow layer, which modulates the rate of sea ice growth because of its highly insulating
properties (Sturm et al., 2002). The phase of the precipitation falling on the sea ice pack is also important. As rain,
it can melt, compact, and densify the snowpack, thus reducing the surface albedo and promoting sea ice melt (Perovich
et al., 2002).The recent snowfall decline in summer is essentially caused by changes in precipitation form (snow
turning to rain) with very little influence of decreases in total precipitation, which is a result of
lower-atmospheric warming. Then the loss of snow-on-ice results in a substantial decrease in the surface albedo over
the Arctic Ocean, causing additional surface ice melt by absorbing more solar radiation (Screen and Simmonds, 2012).

CAUSALITY BETWEEN ATMOSPHERIC PROCESSES AND ARCTIC SEA ICE VARIATIONS
Due to the two-way interactions between the atmosphere and sea ice, studying causality between them is a challenging but
important task, which makes it an area of high interest within polar climate community. The sea ice variations can be
caused by different dynamical and thermodynamical processes. Important dynamical processes include anomalous surface
wind (Spreen et al., 2011; Wu et al., 2012), regional atmospheric circulation patterns (Overland and Wang, 2010;
Screen et al., 2018; Rinke et al., 2019) and abnormal storm activities (Simmonds et al., 2008; Simmonds and Keay, 2009;
Screen et al., 2011; Simmonds and Rudeva, 2012; Parkinson and Comiso, 2013; Simmonds and Rudeva, 2014). Cloud (Kapsch
et al., 2013), radiation (Kay and Gettelman, 2009; Choi et al., 2014) and precipitation (Boisvert et al., 2018; Wang
et al., 2019; Marcovecchio et al., 2021) are the important thermodynamic factors controlling Arctic sea ice trends
and variability. On the other hand, sea ice decline in turn exerts large influence on the atmosphere, including
cloud (Kay and Gettelman, 2009; Morrison et al., 2018), surface energy budget (Semmler et al., 2012; Boisvert et al.,
2015; Boisvert and Stroeve, 2015), precipitation (Bintanja and Selten, 2014; Kopec et al., 2016) and large-scale
circulation (Chemke et al., 2019; Kennel and Yulaeva, 2020). Figure 1 depicts the causal relations between key
atmospheric variables and sea ice over the Arctic. The sea ice here represents sea ice coverage and/or sea ice
thickness. Note that the processes a âˆ’ d are well-known atmospheric processes, including cloud microphysics,
thermodynamics, radiation, climate dynamics, which have been studied over the past few decades. The processes
e âˆ’ i are summarized from more recent publications, which are still under investigation by climate scientists.
We will explain processes e âˆ’ i in details in the next paragraph. The arrow e represents the two-way effect between
sea ice and net longwave flux at the surface. Based on global reanalysis (Kapsch et al., 2013; Lee et al., 2017),
surface (Cox et al., 2016) and satellite observations (Huang et al., 2017), as well as model simulations (Kapsch et
al., 2016; Huang et al., 2019a), the downward longwave radiation at the surface dominates surface warming and
therefore enhances sea ice melt in winter and spring. The increase in downward longwave flux is a result of an
increase in cloudiness and moisture in the Arctic Basin, which is caused by enhanced local evaporation or moisture
transport from mid-latitudes (Luo et al., 2017). Positive anomalies of longwave flux in spring and early summer
initiate an earlier melt onset, thereby triggering several feedback mechanisms which amplify melt during the
succeeding months (Kapsch et al., 2016; Huang et al., 2019b). The sea ice melt increases the air temperature

atmospheric processes with changes in Arctic sea ice. Therefore, in this study, we target to provide a more
comprehensive analysis about causality between multiple atmospheric processes and sea ice by applying different
data-driven causality approaches.

Huang et al. Arctic Sea Ice Causality Discovery surface. The downward shortwave flux, however, appears only
important after the melt has started (Kapsch et al., 2013; Huang et al., 2017). Once the surface albedo is
significantly reduced due to sea ice melt, the solar radiation could be absorbed by ocean, which further
accelerates ice melt in late spring and summer (Kay and Gettelman, 2009; Choi et al., 2014; Kapsch et al., 2016).
The feedback between surface net shortwave flux and sea ice, represented by arrow f in Figure 1, has been
confirmed by both model simulations (Kapsch et al., 2016) and satellite observations (Kay and Gettelman, 2009;
Nussbaumer and Pinker, 2012; Choi et al., 2014). The arrows g indicate the interactions between the sea ice variations
and atmospheric dynamical processes. A series of studies demonstrated that recent loss of Arctic sea ice is triggered
by the atmospheric circulation changes such as a tendency toward a dipole pattern in the mean sea level pressure trend
with an increase over the Arctic Ocean and a decrease over Siberia. The Arctic dipole anomaly in summer
(Wang et al., 2009), winter (Watanabe et al., 2006) and spring (Kapsch et al., 2019) produces a strong meridional
wind (v-component) anomaly that drives more sea ice out of the Arctic Ocean. In addition, this dipole anomaly promotes
transport of heat and moisture and thus enhances downward longwave radiation and control the melt onset
(Huang et al., 2019b; Kapsch et al., 2019). Moreover, the changes in cyclone occurrence and/or depth during spring
(Screen et al., 2011) and summer (Simmonds and Rudeva, 2012) have preconditioning effects on the sea ice cover and
exert a strong influence on the amount of sea ice that survives the melt season. A recent study also pointed out that
a stronger anticyclonic circulation over Greenland and the Arctic Ocean in the troposphere may have contributed as much
as 60% to the September sea ice extent decline since 1979, by warming and moistening the lower atmosphere

These conclusions are mainly drawn from in-situ measurements during field campaign (Perovich et al., 2002; Sturm et al.,
2002), global reanalysis products and surface observations (Screen and Simmonds, 2012; Boisvert et al., 2018;
Wang et al., 2019). The higher precipitation and snowfall could result in a thicker snowpack that allows less heat
loss to the atmosphere. More importantly, modeling studies suggest that increases in Arctic precipitation over the
21st century, particularly in late autumn and winter, are due mainly to strongly intensified local surface evaporation
(latent heat flux) (Bintanja and Selten, 2014). Therefore, we believe that Arctic precipitation exerts direct influence
on sea ice variations (arrow i), while sea ice modulates precipitation mainly through sensible plus latent heat flux
(arrows h, b). Among these studies, very few of them have demonstrated the delayed impact of one variable on another.
Specifically, the net shortwave flux at the surface in early summer (Mayâ€“July) is found to enhance sea ice melt with a
lag of 1â€“4 months (Choi et al., 2014). Moreover, the sea ice condition exhibits the delayed impacts on itself, which is
called sea ice anomaly persistence (Guemas et al., 2016; Cruz-GarcÃ­a et al., 2019; Holland et al., 2019). The sea ice
anomaly persistence depends on the predictand (area, extent, volume), region, and the initial and target dates, which
can be varied from a few days to a few years (Guemas et al., 2016). With sea ice anomaly persistence,
there is predictability for the sea ice area in winter but low predictability throughout the rest of the year in
peripheral seas. Based on multiple model simulations, the Labrador Sea stands out among the considered regions,
with sea ice predictability extending up to 1.5 years (Cruz-GarcÃ­a et al., 2019). Note that most of studies mentioned
above determine the changes in one variable, happening before another one, by applying time series analysis and/or
composite analysis based on observations, reanalysis or model output (Perovich et al., 2002; Sturm et al., 2002; Kay

et al., 2002).The recent snowfall decline in summer is essentially caused by changes in precipitation form (snow
turning to rain) with very little influence of decreases in total precipitation, which is a result of
lower-atmospheric warming. Then the loss of snow-on-ice results in a substantial decrease in the surface albedo over
the Arctic Ocean, causing additional surface ice melt by absorbing more solar radiation (Screen and Simmonds, 2012).

CAUSALITY BETWEEN ATMOSPHERIC PROCESSES AND ARCTIC SEA ICE VARIATIONS
Due to the two-way interactions between the atmosphere and sea ice, studying causality between them is a challenging but
important task, which makes it an area of high interest within polar climate community. The sea ice variations can be
caused by different dynamical and thermodynamical processes. Important dynamical processes include anomalous surface
wind (Spreen et al., 2011; Wu et al., 2012), regional atmospheric circulation patterns (Overland and Wang, 2010;
Screen et al., 2018; Rinke et al., 2019) and abnormal storm activities (Simmonds et al., 2008; Simmonds and Keay, 2009;
Screen et al., 2011; Simmonds and Rudeva, 2012; Parkinson and Comiso, 2013; Simmonds and Rudeva, 2014). Cloud (Kapsch
et al., 2013), radiation (Kay and Gettelman, 2009; Choi et al., 2014) and precipitation (Boisvert et al., 2018; Wang
et al., 2019; Marcovecchio et al., 2021) are the important thermodynamic factors controlling Arctic sea ice trends
and variability. On the other hand, sea ice decline in turn exerts large influence on the atmosphere, including
cloud (Kay and Gettelman, 2009; Morrison et al., 2018), surface energy budget (Semmler et al., 2012; Boisvert et al.,
2015; Boisvert and Stroeve, 2015), precipitation (Bintanja and Selten, 2014; Kopec et al., 2016) and large-scale
circulation (Chemke et al., 2019; Kennel and Yulaeva, 2020). Figure 1 depicts the causal relations between key
atmospheric variables and sea ice over the Arctic. The sea ice here represents sea ice coverage and/or sea ice

e âˆ’ i are summarized from more recent publications, which are still under investigation by climate scientists.
We will explain processes e âˆ’ i in details in the next paragraph. The arrow e represents the two-way effect between
sea ice and net longwave flux at the surface. Based on global reanalysis (Kapsch et al., 2013; Lee et al., 2017),
surface (Cox et al., 2016) and satellite observations (Huang et al., 2017), as well as model simulations (Kapsch et
al., 2016; Huang et al., 2019a), the downward longwave radiation at the surface dominates surface warming and
therefore enhances sea ice melt in winter and spring. The increase in downward longwave flux is a result of an
increase in cloudiness and moisture in the Arctic Basin, which is caused by enhanced local evaporation or moisture
transport from mid-latitudes (Luo et al., 2017). Positive anomalies of longwave flux in spring and early summer
initiate an earlier melt onset, thereby triggering several feedback mechanisms which amplify melt during the
succeeding months (Kapsch et al., 2016; Huang et al., 2019b). The sea ice melt increases the air temperature

atmospheric processes with changes in Arctic sea ice. Therefore, in this study, we target to provide a more
comprehensive analysis about causality between multiple atmospheric processes and sea ice by applying different
data-driven causality approaches.

Huang et al. Arctic Sea Ice Causality Discovery surface. The downward shortwave flux, however, appears only
important after the melt has started (Kapsch et al., 2013; Huang et al., 2017). Once the surface albedo is
significantly reduced due to sea ice melt, the solar radiation could be absorbed by ocean, which further
accelerates ice melt in late spring and summer (Kay and Gettelman, 2009; Choi et al., 2014; Kapsch et al., 2016).
The feedback between surface net shortwave flux and sea ice, represented by arrow f in Figure 1, has been
confirmed by both model simulations (Kapsch et al., 2016) and satellite observations (Kay and Gettelman, 2009;
Nussbaumer and Pinker, 2012; Choi et al., 2014). The arrows g indicate the interactions between the sea ice variations
and atmospheric dynamical processes. A series of studies demonstrated that recent loss of Arctic sea ice is triggered
by the atmospheric circulation changes such as a tendency toward a dipole pattern in the mean sea level pressure trend
with an increase over the Arctic Ocean and a decrease over Siberia. The Arctic dipole anomaly in summer
(Wang et al., 2009), winter (Watanabe et al., 2006) and spring (Kapsch et al., 2019) produces a strong meridional
wind (v-component) anomaly that drives more sea ice out of the Arctic Ocean. In addition, this dipole anomaly promotes
transport of heat and moisture and thus enhances downward longwave radiation and control the melt onset
(Huang et al., 2019b; Kapsch et al., 2019). Moreover, the changes in cyclone occurrence and/or depth during spring
(Screen et al., 2011) and summer (Simmonds and Rudeva, 2012) have preconditioning effects on the sea ice cover and
exert a strong influence on the amount of sea ice that survives the melt season. A recent study also pointed out that
a stronger anticyclonic circulation over Greenland and the Arctic Ocean in the troposphere may have contributed as much
as 60% to the September sea ice extent decline since 1979, by warming and moistening the lower atmosphere

These conclusions are mainly drawn from in-situ measurements during field campaign (Perovich et al., 2002; Sturm et al.,
2002), global reanalysis products and surface observations (Screen and Simmonds, 2012; Boisvert et al., 2018;
Wang et al., 2019). The higher precipitation and snowfall could result in a thicker snowpack that allows less heat
loss to the atmosphere. More importantly, modeling studies suggest that increases in Arctic precipitation over the
21st century, particularly in late autumn and winter, are due mainly to strongly intensified local surface evaporation
(latent heat flux) (Bintanja and Selten, 2014). Therefore, we believe that Arctic precipitation exerts direct influence
on sea ice variations (arrow i), while sea ice modulates precipitation mainly through sensible plus latent heat flux
(arrows h, b). Among these studies, very few of them have demonstrated the delayed impact of one variable on another.
Specifically, the net shortwave flux at the surface in early summer (Mayâ€“July) is found to enhance sea ice melt with a
lag of 1â€“4 months (Choi et al., 2014). Moreover, the sea ice condition exhibits the delayed impacts on itself, which is
called sea ice anomaly persistence (Guemas et al., 2016; Cruz-GarcÃ­a et al., 2019; Holland et al., 2019). The sea ice
anomaly persistence depends on the predictand (area, extent, volume), region, and the initial and target dates, which
can be varied from a few days to a few years (Guemas et al., 2016). With sea ice anomaly persistence,
there is predictability for the sea ice area in winter but low predictability throughout the rest of the year in
peripheral seas. Based on multiple model simulations, the Labrador Sea stands out among the considered regions,
with sea ice predictability extending up to 1.5 years (Cruz-GarcÃ­a et al., 2019). Note that most of studies mentioned
above determine the changes in one variable, happening before another one, by applying time series analysis and/or
composite analysis based on observations, reanalysis or model output (Perovich et al., 2002; Sturm et al., 2002; Kay
and Gettelman, 2009; Wang et al., 2009; Nussbaumer and Pinker, 2012; Kapsch et al., 2013; Choi et al., 2014; Boisvert

2018; Wang et al., 2019). Among them, some studies use more advanced statistical analysis such as empirical orthogonal
function (Watanabe et al., 2006; Overland and Wang, 2010) and self-organizing map (Kapsch et al., 2019; Rinke et al.,
2019). Other studies assess the causal links through targeted modeling experiments (Bintanja and Selten, 2014; Kapsch
et al., 2016; Ding et al., 2017; Huang et al., 2019a; Cruz-GarcÃ­a et al., 2019), in order to test whether a manipulation
of one variable has an impact on others. And most of the studies focus on relationships between only one or two

(Ding et al., 2017; Huang et al., 2021; Luo et al., 2021). On the other hand, the reduction in Arctic sea ice extent
and increase in open water area in late summer are found to directly contribute to a modification of large-scale

Huang et al. Arctic Sea Ice Causality Discovery circulation patterns in the following autumn through the additional
heat stored in the Arctic Ocean and released to the atmosphere during the autumn (Overland and Wang, 2010). The
increased 1,000â€“500 hPa thickness in autumn produce anomalous easterley zonal wind component (u-component), especially
over the north of Alaska and Canada. Moreover, a more meridional flow pattern associated with sea ice reduction have
an impact on the mid-latitude weather (Overland and Wang, 2010). These conclusions are mainly drawn from model
simulations (Watanabe et al., 2006; Rinke et al., 2019), reanalysis and observations (Wang et al., 2009; Overland and
Wang, 2010; Kapsch et al., 2019). In addition to radiation, the sensible plus latent heat flux also plays an important
role in the Arctic energy budget. The increase in the downward moisture flux triggers the melting of the sea ice in
spring (Boisvert et al., 2015; Boisvert and Stroeve, 2015; Marcovecchio et al., 2021). Earlier melt onset and loss of
sea ice in the spring enhance warming of the ice-free ocean surface, which in turn leads to an increase of evaporation
from the surface into the atmosphere in the autumn. This positive feedback between heat flux and sea ice, indicated
by arrow h, has been confirmed by satellite observations (Boisvert et al., 2015; Boisvert and Stroeve, 2015) and model
simulations (Huang et al., 2019a) during most months of the year. The arrow i represents the influence of precipitation
on Arctic sea ice variations. Specifically, the magnitude of precipitation accumulating over the sea ice pack largely
determines the depth of the snow layer, which modulates the rate of sea ice growth because of its highly insulating
properties (Sturm et al., 2002). The phase of the precipitation falling on the sea ice pack is also important. As rain,

surface (Cox et al., 2016) and satellite observations (Huang et al., 2017), as well as model simulations (Kapsch et
al., 2016; Huang et al., 2019a), the downward longwave radiation at the surface dominates surface warming and
therefore enhances sea ice melt in winter and spring. The increase in downward longwave flux is a result of an
increase in cloudiness and moisture in the Arctic Basin, which is caused by enhanced local evaporation or moisture
transport from mid-latitudes (Luo et al., 2017). Positive anomalies of longwave flux in spring and early summer
initiate an earlier melt onset, thereby triggering several feedback mechanisms which amplify melt during the
succeeding months (Kapsch et al., 2016; Huang et al., 2019b). The sea ice melt increases the air temperature

atmospheric processes with changes in Arctic sea ice. Therefore, in this study, we target to provide a more
comprehensive analysis about causality between multiple atmospheric processes and sea ice by applying different
data-driven causality approaches.

Huang et al. Arctic Sea Ice Causality Discovery surface. The downward shortwave flux, however, appears only
important after the melt has started (Kapsch et al., 2013; Huang et al., 2017). Once the surface albedo is
significantly reduced due to sea ice melt, the solar radiation could be absorbed by ocean, which further
accelerates ice melt in late spring and summer (Kay and Gettelman, 2009; Choi et al., 2014; Kapsch et al., 2016).
The feedback between surface net shortwave flux and sea ice, represented by arrow f in Figure 1, has been
confirmed by both model simulations (Kapsch et al., 2016) and satellite observations (Kay and Gettelman, 2009;
Nussbaumer and Pinker, 2012; Choi et al., 2014). The arrows g indicate the interactions between the sea ice variations
and atmospheric dynamical processes. A series of studies demonstrated that recent loss of Arctic sea ice is triggered
by the atmospheric circulation changes such as a tendency toward a dipole pattern in the mean sea level pressure trend
with an increase over the Arctic Ocean and a decrease over Siberia. The Arctic dipole anomaly in summer
(Wang et al., 2009), winter (Watanabe et al., 2006) and spring (Kapsch et al., 2019) produces a strong meridional
wind (v-component) anomaly that drives more sea ice out of the Arctic Ocean. In addition, this dipole anomaly promotes
transport of heat and moisture and thus enhances downward longwave radiation and control the melt onset
(Huang et al., 2019b; Kapsch et al., 2019). Moreover, the changes in cyclone occurrence and/or depth during spring
(Screen et al., 2011) and summer (Simmonds and Rudeva, 2012) have preconditioning effects on the sea ice cover and
exert a strong influence on the amount of sea ice that survives the melt season. A recent study also pointed out that
a stronger anticyclonic circulation over Greenland and the Arctic Ocean in the troposphere may have contributed as much
as 60% to the September sea ice extent decline since 1979, by warming and moistening the lower atmosphere

These conclusions are mainly drawn from in-situ measurements during field campaign (Perovich et al., 2002; Sturm et al.,
2002), global reanalysis products and surface observations (Screen and Simmonds, 2012; Boisvert et al., 2018;
Wang et al., 2019). The higher precipitation and snowfall could result in a thicker snowpack that allows less heat
loss to the atmosphere. More importantly, modeling studies suggest that increases in Arctic precipitation over the
21st century, particularly in late autumn and winter, are due mainly to strongly intensified local surface evaporation
(latent heat flux) (Bintanja and Selten, 2014). Therefore, we believe that Arctic precipitation exerts direct influence
on sea ice variations (arrow i), while sea ice modulates precipitation mainly through sensible plus latent heat flux
(arrows h, b). Among these studies, very few of them have demonstrated the delayed impact of one variable on another.
Specifically, the net shortwave flux at the surface in early summer (Mayâ€“July) is found to enhance sea ice melt with a
lag of 1â€“4 months (Choi et al., 2014). Moreover, the sea ice condition exhibits the delayed impacts on itself, which is
called sea ice anomaly persistence (Guemas et al., 2016; Cruz-GarcÃ­a et al., 2019; Holland et al., 2019). The sea ice
anomaly persistence depends on the predictand (area, extent, volume), region, and the initial and target dates, which
can be varied from a few days to a few years (Guemas et al., 2016). With sea ice anomaly persistence,
there is predictability for the sea ice area in winter but low predictability throughout the rest of the year in
peripheral seas. Based on multiple model simulations, the Labrador Sea stands out among the considered regions,
with sea ice predictability extending up to 1.5 years (Cruz-GarcÃ­a et al., 2019). Note that most of studies mentioned
above determine the changes in one variable, happening before another one, by applying time series analysis and/or
composite analysis based on observations, reanalysis or model output (Perovich et al., 2002; Sturm et al., 2002; Kay
and Gettelman, 2009; Wang et al., 2009; Nussbaumer and Pinker, 2012; Kapsch et al., 2013; Choi et al., 2014; Boisvert
et al., 2015; Boisvert and Stroeve, 2015; Cox et al., 2016; Huang et al., 2017; Huang et al., 2019b; Boisvert et al.,
2018; Wang et al., 2019). Among them, some studies use more advanced statistical analysis such as empirical orthogonal
function (Watanabe et al., 2006; Overland and Wang, 2010) and self-organizing map (Kapsch et al., 2019; Rinke et al.,
2019). Other studies assess the causal links through targeted modeling experiments (Bintanja and Selten, 2014; Kapsch
et al., 2016; Ding et al., 2017; Huang et al., 2019a; Cruz-GarcÃ­a et al., 2019), in order to test whether a manipulation
of one variable has an impact on others. And most of the studies focus on relationships between only one or two

(Ding et al., 2017; Huang et al., 2021; Luo et al., 2021). On the other hand, the reduction in Arctic sea ice extent
and increase in open water area in late summer are found to directly contribute to a modification of large-scale

Huang et al. Arctic Sea Ice Causality Discovery circulation patterns in the following autumn through the additional
heat stored in the Arctic Ocean and released to the atmosphere during the autumn (Overland and Wang, 2010). The
increased 1,000â€“500 hPa thickness in autumn produce anomalous easterley zonal wind component (u-component), especially
over the north of Alaska and Canada. Moreover, a more meridional flow pattern associated with sea ice reduction have
an impact on the mid-latitude weather (Overland and Wang, 2010). These conclusions are mainly drawn from model
simulations (Watanabe et al., 2006; Rinke et al., 2019), reanalysis and observations (Wang et al., 2009; Overland and
Wang, 2010; Kapsch et al., 2019). In addition to radiation, the sensible plus latent heat flux also plays an important
role in the Arctic energy budget. The increase in the downward moisture flux triggers the melting of the sea ice in
spring (Boisvert et al., 2015; Boisvert and Stroeve, 2015; Marcovecchio et al., 2021). Earlier melt onset and loss of
sea ice in the spring enhance warming of the ice-free ocean surface, which in turn leads to an increase of evaporation
from the surface into the atmosphere in the autumn. This positive feedback between heat flux and sea ice, indicated
by arrow h, has been confirmed by satellite observations (Boisvert et al., 2015; Boisvert and Stroeve, 2015) and model
simulations (Huang et al., 2019a) during most months of the year. The arrow i represents the influence of precipitation
on Arctic sea ice variations. Specifically, the magnitude of precipitation accumulating over the sea ice pack largely
determines the depth of the snow layer, which modulates the rate of sea ice growth because of its highly insulating
properties (Sturm et al., 2002). The phase of the precipitation falling on the sea ice pack is also important. As rain,
it can melt, compact, and densify the snowpack, thus reducing the surface albedo and promoting sea ice melt (Perovich
et al., 2002).The recent snowfall decline in summer is essentially caused by changes in precipitation form (snow
turning to rain) with very little influence of decreases in total precipitation, which is a result of
lower-atmospheric warming. Then the loss of snow-on-ice results in a substantial decrease in the surface albedo over
the Arctic Ocean, causing additional surface ice melt by absorbing more solar radiation (Screen and Simmonds, 2012).

CAUSALITY BETWEEN ATMOSPHERIC PROCESSES AND ARCTIC SEA ICE VARIATIONS
Due to the two-way interactions between the atmosphere and sea ice, studying causality between them is a challenging but
important task, which makes it an area of high interest within polar climate community. The sea ice variations can be
caused by different dynamical and thermodynamical processes. Important dynamical processes include anomalous surface
wind (Spreen et al., 2011; Wu et al., 2012), regional atmospheric circulation patterns (Overland and Wang, 2010;
Screen et al., 2018; Rinke et al., 2019) and abnormal storm activities (Simmonds et al., 2008; Simmonds and Keay, 2009;
Screen et al., 2011; Simmonds and Rudeva, 2012; Parkinson and Comiso, 2013; Simmonds and Rudeva, 2014). Cloud (Kapsch
et al., 2013), radiation (Kay and Gettelman, 2009; Choi et al., 2014) and precipitation (Boisvert et al., 2018; Wang
et al., 2019; Marcovecchio et al., 2021) are the important thermodynamic factors controlling Arctic sea ice trends
and variability. On the other hand, sea ice decline in turn exerts large influence on the atmosphere, including
cloud (Kay and Gettelman, 2009; Morrison et al., 2018), surface energy budget (Semmler et al., 2012; Boisvert et al.,
2015; Boisvert and Stroeve, 2015), precipitation (Bintanja and Selten, 2014; Kopec et al., 2016) and large-scale
circulation (Chemke et al., 2019; Kennel and Yulaeva, 2020). Figure 1 depicts the causal relations between key
atmospheric variables and sea ice over the Arctic. The sea ice here represents sea ice coverage and/or sea ice
thickness. Note that the processes a âˆ’ d are well-known atmospheric processes, including cloud microphysics,
thermodynamics, radiation, climate dynamics, which have been studied over the past few decades. The processes
e âˆ’ i are summarized from more recent publications, which are still under investigation by climate scientists.

accelerates ice melt in late spring and summer (Kay and Gettelman, 2009; Choi et al., 2014; Kapsch et al., 2016).
The feedback between surface net shortwave flux and sea ice, represented by arrow f in Figure 1, has been
confirmed by both model simulations (Kapsch et al., 2016) and satellite observations (Kay and Gettelman, 2009;
Nussbaumer and Pinker, 2012; Choi et al., 2014). The arrows g indicate the interactions between the sea ice variations
and atmospheric dynamical processes. A series of studies demonstrated that recent loss of Arctic sea ice is triggered
by the atmospheric circulation changes such as a tendency toward a dipole pattern in the mean sea level pressure trend
with an increase over the Arctic Ocean and a decrease over Siberia. The Arctic dipole anomaly in summer
(Wang et al., 2009), winter (Watanabe et al., 2006) and spring (Kapsch et al., 2019) produces a strong meridional
wind (v-component) anomaly that drives more sea ice out of the Arctic Ocean. In addition, this dipole anomaly promotes
transport of heat and moisture and thus enhances downward longwave radiation and control the melt onset
(Huang et al., 2019b; Kapsch et al., 2019). Moreover, the changes in cyclone occurrence and/or depth during spring
(Screen et al., 2011) and summer (Simmonds and Rudeva, 2012) have preconditioning effects on the sea ice cover and
exert a strong influence on the amount of sea ice that survives the melt season. A recent study also pointed out that
a stronger anticyclonic circulation over Greenland and the Arctic Ocean in the troposphere may have contributed as much
as 60% to the September sea ice extent decline since 1979, by warming and moistening the lower atmosphere

These conclusions are mainly drawn from in-situ measurements during field campaign (Perovich et al., 2002; Sturm et al.,
2002), global reanalysis products and surface observations (Screen and Simmonds, 2012; Boisvert et al., 2018;
Wang et al., 2019). The higher precipitation and snowfall could result in a thicker snowpack that allows less heat
loss to the atmosphere. More importantly, modeling studies suggest that increases in Arctic precipitation over the
21st century, particularly in late autumn and winter, are due mainly to strongly intensified local surface evaporation
(latent heat flux) (Bintanja and Selten, 2014). Therefore, we believe that Arctic precipitation exerts direct influence
on sea ice variations (arrow i), while sea ice modulates precipitation mainly through sensible plus latent heat flux
(arrows h, b). Among these studies, very few of them have demonstrated the delayed impact of one variable on another.
Specifically, the net shortwave flux at the surface in early summer (Mayâ€“July) is found to enhance sea ice melt with a
lag of 1â€“4 months (Choi et al., 2014). Moreover, the sea ice condition exhibits the delayed impacts on itself, which is
called sea ice anomaly persistence (Guemas et al., 2016; Cruz-GarcÃ­a et al., 2019; Holland et al., 2019). The sea ice
anomaly persistence depends on the predictand (area, extent, volume), region, and the initial and target dates, which
can be varied from a few days to a few years (Guemas et al., 2016). With sea ice anomaly persistence,
there is predictability for the sea ice area in winter but low predictability throughout the rest of the year in
peripheral seas. Based on multiple model simulations, the Labrador Sea stands out among the considered regions,
with sea ice predictability extending up to 1.5 years (Cruz-GarcÃ­a et al., 2019). Note that most of studies mentioned
above determine the changes in one variable, happening before another one, by applying time series analysis and/or
composite analysis based on observations, reanalysis or model output (Perovich et al., 2002; Sturm et al., 2002; Kay
and Gettelman, 2009; Wang et al., 2009; Nussbaumer and Pinker, 2012; Kapsch et al., 2013; Choi et al., 2014; Boisvert
et al., 2015; Boisvert and Stroeve, 2015; Cox et al., 2016; Huang et al., 2017; Huang et al., 2019b; Boisvert et al.,
2018; Wang et al., 2019). Among them, some studies use more advanced statistical analysis such as empirical orthogonal
function (Watanabe et al., 2006; Overland and Wang, 2010) and self-organizing map (Kapsch et al., 2019; Rinke et al.,
2019). Other studies assess the causal links through targeted modeling experiments (Bintanja and Selten, 2014; Kapsch
et al., 2016; Ding et al., 2017; Huang et al., 2019a; Cruz-GarcÃ­a et al., 2019), in order to test whether a manipulation
of one variable has an impact on others. And most of the studies focus on relationships between only one or two

(Ding et al., 2017; Huang et al., 2021; Luo et al., 2021). On the other hand, the reduction in Arctic sea ice extent
and increase in open water area in late summer are found to directly contribute to a modification of large-scale

Huang et al. Arctic Sea Ice Causality Discovery circulation patterns in the following autumn through the additional
heat stored in the Arctic Ocean and released to the atmosphere during the autumn (Overland and Wang, 2010). The
increased 1,000â€“500 hPa thickness in autumn produce anomalous easterley zonal wind component (u-component), especially
over the north of Alaska and Canada. Moreover, a more meridional flow pattern associated with sea ice reduction have
an impact on the mid-latitude weather (Overland and Wang, 2010). These conclusions are mainly drawn from model
simulations (Watanabe et al., 2006; Rinke et al., 2019), reanalysis and observations (Wang et al., 2009; Overland and
Wang, 2010; Kapsch et al., 2019). In addition to radiation, the sensible plus latent heat flux also plays an important
role in the Arctic energy budget. The increase in the downward moisture flux triggers the melting of the sea ice in
spring (Boisvert et al., 2015; Boisvert and Stroeve, 2015; Marcovecchio et al., 2021). Earlier melt onset and loss of
sea ice in the spring enhance warming of the ice-free ocean surface, which in turn leads to an increase of evaporation
from the surface into the atmosphere in the autumn. This positive feedback between heat flux and sea ice, indicated
by arrow h, has been confirmed by satellite observations (Boisvert et al., 2015; Boisvert and Stroeve, 2015) and model
simulations (Huang et al., 2019a) during most months of the year. The arrow i represents the influence of precipitation
on Arctic sea ice variations. Specifically, the magnitude of precipitation accumulating over the sea ice pack largely
determines the depth of the snow layer, which modulates the rate of sea ice growth because of its highly insulating
properties (Sturm et al., 2002). The phase of the precipitation falling on the sea ice pack is also important. As rain,
it can melt, compact, and densify the snowpack, thus reducing the surface albedo and promoting sea ice melt (Perovich
et al., 2002).The recent snowfall decline in summer is essentially caused by changes in precipitation form (snow
turning to rain) with very little influence of decreases in total precipitation, which is a result of
lower-atmospheric warming. Then the loss of snow-on-ice results in a substantial decrease in the surface albedo over
the Arctic Ocean, causing additional surface ice melt by absorbing more solar radiation (Screen and Simmonds, 2012).

CAUSALITY BETWEEN ATMOSPHERIC PROCESSES AND ARCTIC SEA ICE VARIATIONS
Due to the two-way interactions between the atmosphere and sea ice, studying causality between them is a challenging but
important task, which makes it an area of high interest within polar climate community. The sea ice variations can be
caused by different dynamical and thermodynamical processes. Important dynamical processes include anomalous surface
wind (Spreen et al., 2011; Wu et al., 2012), regional atmospheric circulation patterns (Overland and Wang, 2010;
Screen et al., 2018; Rinke et al., 2019) and abnormal storm activities (Simmonds et al., 2008; Simmonds and Keay, 2009;
Screen et al., 2011; Simmonds and Rudeva, 2012; Parkinson and Comiso, 2013; Simmonds and Rudeva, 2014). Cloud (Kapsch
et al., 2013), radiation (Kay and Gettelman, 2009; Choi et al., 2014) and precipitation (Boisvert et al., 2018; Wang
et al., 2019; Marcovecchio et al., 2021) are the important thermodynamic factors controlling Arctic sea ice trends
and variability. On the other hand, sea ice decline in turn exerts large influence on the atmosphere, including
cloud (Kay and Gettelman, 2009; Morrison et al., 2018), surface energy budget (Semmler et al., 2012; Boisvert et al.,
2015; Boisvert and Stroeve, 2015), precipitation (Bintanja and Selten, 2014; Kopec et al., 2016) and large-scale
circulation (Chemke et al., 2019; Kennel and Yulaeva, 2020). Figure 1 depicts the causal relations between key
atmospheric variables and sea ice over the Arctic. The sea ice here represents sea ice coverage and/or sea ice
thickness. Note that the processes a âˆ’ d are well-known atmospheric processes, including cloud microphysics,
thermodynamics, radiation, climate dynamics, which have been studied over the past few decades. The processes
e âˆ’ i are summarized from more recent publications, which are still under investigation by climate scientists.
We will explain processes e âˆ’ i in details in the next paragraph. The arrow e represents the two-way effect between
sea ice and net longwave flux at the surface. Based on global reanalysis (Kapsch et al., 2013; Lee et al., 2017),
surface (Cox et al., 2016) and satellite observations (Huang et al., 2017), as well as model simulations (Kapsch et
al., 2016; Huang et al., 2019a), the downward longwave radiation at the surface dominates surface warming and
therefore enhances sea ice melt in winter and spring. The increase in downward longwave flux is a result of an
increase in cloudiness and moisture in the Arctic Basin, which is caused by enhanced local evaporation or moisture
transport from mid-latitudes (Luo et al., 2017). Positive anomalies of longwave flux in spring and early summer
initiate an earlier melt onset, thereby triggering several feedback mechanisms which amplify melt during the
succeeding months (Kapsch et al., 2016; Huang et al., 2019b). The sea ice melt increases the air temperature

atmospheric processes with changes in Arctic sea ice. Therefore, in this study, we target to provide a more
comprehensive analysis about causality between multiple atmospheric processes and sea ice by applying different
data-driven causality approaches.

(Wang et al., 2009), winter (Watanabe et al., 2006) and spring (Kapsch et al., 2019) produces a strong meridional
wind (v-component) anomaly that drives more sea ice out of the Arctic Ocean. In addition, this dipole anomaly promotes
transport of heat and moisture and thus enhances downward longwave radiation and control the melt onset
(Huang et al., 2019b; Kapsch et al., 2019). Moreover, the changes in cyclone occurrence and/or depth during spring

loss to the atmosphere. More importantly, modeling studies suggest that increases in Arctic precipitation over the

(latent heat flux) (Bintanja and Selten, 2014). Therefore, we believe that Arctic precipitation exerts direct influence

Specifically, the net shortwave flux at the surface in early summer (Mayâ€“July) is found to enhance sea ice melt with a

anomaly persistence depends on the predictand (area, extent, volume), region, and the initial and target dates, which
can be varied from a few days to a few years (Guemas et al., 2016). With sea ice anomaly persistence,
there is predictability for the sea ice area in winter but low predictability throughout the rest of the year in
peripheral seas. Based on multiple model simulations, the Labrador Sea stands out among the considered regions,
with sea ice predictability extending up to 1.5 years (Cruz-GarcÃ­a et al., 2019). Note that most of studies mentioned
above determine the changes in one variable, happening before another one, by applying time series analysis and/or
composite analysis based on observations, reanalysis or model output (Perovich et al., 2002; Sturm et al., 2002; Kay

2018; Wang et al., 2019). Among them, some studies use more advanced statistical analysis such as empirical orthogonal
function (Watanabe et al., 2006; Overland and Wang, 2010) and self-organizing map (Kapsch et al., 2019; Rinke et al.,
2019). Other studies assess the causal links through targeted modeling experiments (Bintanja and Selten, 2014; Kapsch
et al., 2016; Ding et al., 2017; Huang et al., 2019a; Cruz-GarcÃ­a et al., 2019), in order to test whether a manipulation
of one variable has an impact on others. And most of the studies focus on relationships between only one or two

(Ding et al., 2017; Huang et al., 2021; Luo et al., 2021). On the other hand, the reduction in Arctic sea ice extent
and increase in open water area in late summer are found to directly contribute to a modification of large-scale

Huang et al. Arctic Sea Ice Causality Discovery circulation patterns in the following autumn through the additional
heat stored in the Arctic Ocean and released to the atmosphere during the autumn (Overland and Wang, 2010). The
increased 1,000â€“500 hPa thickness in autumn produce anomalous easterley zonal wind component (u-component), especially
over the north of Alaska and Canada. Moreover, a more meridional flow pattern associated with sea ice reduction have
an impact on the mid-latitude weather (Overland and Wang, 2010). These conclusions are mainly drawn from model
simulations (Watanabe et al., 2006; Rinke et al., 2019), reanalysis and observations (Wang et al., 2009; Overland and
Wang, 2010; Kapsch et al., 2019). In addition to radiation, the sensible plus latent heat flux also plays an important
role in the Arctic energy budget. The increase in the downward moisture flux triggers the melting of the sea ice in
spring (Boisvert et al., 2015; Boisvert and Stroeve, 2015; Marcovecchio et al., 2021). Earlier melt onset and loss of
sea ice in the spring enhance warming of the ice-free ocean surface, which in turn leads to an increase of evaporation
from the surface into the atmosphere in the autumn. This positive feedback between heat flux and sea ice, indicated
by arrow h, has been confirmed by satellite observations (Boisvert et al., 2015; Boisvert and Stroeve, 2015) and model
simulations (Huang et al., 2019a) during most months of the year. The arrow i represents the influence of precipitation
on Arctic sea ice variations. Specifically, the magnitude of precipitation accumulating over the sea ice pack largely
determines the depth of the snow layer, which modulates the rate of sea ice growth because of its highly insulating
properties (Sturm et al., 2002). The phase of the precipitation falling on the sea ice pack is also important. As rain,
it can melt, compact, and densify the snowpack, thus reducing the surface albedo and promoting sea ice melt (Perovich
et al., 2002).The recent snowfall decline in summer is essentially caused by changes in precipitation form (snow
turning to rain) with very little influence of decreases in total precipitation, which is a result of
lower-atmospheric warming. Then the loss of snow-on-ice results in a substantial decrease in the surface albedo over
the Arctic Ocean, causing additional surface ice melt by absorbing more solar radiation (Screen and Simmonds, 2012).

CAUSALITY BETWEEN ATMOSPHERIC PROCESSES AND ARCTIC SEA ICE VARIATIONS
Due to the two-way interactions between the atmosphere and sea ice, studying causality between them is a challenging but
important task, which makes it an area of high interest within polar climate community. The sea ice variations can be
caused by different dynamical and thermodynamical processes. Important dynamical processes include anomalous surface
wind (Spreen et al., 2011; Wu et al., 2012), regional atmospheric circulation patterns (Overland and Wang, 2010;
Screen et al., 2018; Rinke et al., 2019) and abnormal storm activities (Simmonds et al., 2008; Simmonds and Keay, 2009;
Screen et al., 2011; Simmonds and Rudeva, 2012; Parkinson and Comiso, 2013; Simmonds and Rudeva, 2014). Cloud (Kapsch
et al., 2013), radiation (Kay and Gettelman, 2009; Choi et al., 2014) and precipitation (Boisvert et al., 2018; Wang
et al., 2019; Marcovecchio et al., 2021) are the important thermodynamic factors controlling Arctic sea ice trends
and variability. On the other hand, sea ice decline in turn exerts large influence on the atmosphere, including
cloud (Kay and Gettelman, 2009; Morrison et al., 2018), surface energy budget (Semmler et al., 2012; Boisvert et al.,
2015; Boisvert and Stroeve, 2015), precipitation (Bintanja and Selten, 2014; Kopec et al., 2016) and large-scale
circulation (Chemke et al., 2019; Kennel and Yulaeva, 2020). Figure 1 depicts the causal relations between key
atmospheric variables and sea ice over the Arctic. The sea ice here represents sea ice coverage and/or sea ice
thickness. Note that the processes a âˆ’ d are well-known atmospheric processes, including cloud microphysics,
thermodynamics, radiation, climate dynamics, which have been studied over the past few decades. The processes
e âˆ’ i are summarized from more recent publications, which are still under investigation by climate scientists.
We will explain processes e âˆ’ i in details in the next paragraph. The arrow e represents the two-way effect between
sea ice and net longwave flux at the surface. Based on global reanalysis (Kapsch et al., 2013; Lee et al., 2017),
surface (Cox et al., 2016) and satellite observations (Huang et al., 2017), as well as model simulations (Kapsch et
al., 2016; Huang et al., 2019a), the downward longwave radiation at the surface dominates surface warming and
therefore enhances sea ice melt in winter and spring. The increase in downward longwave flux is a result of an
increase in cloudiness and moisture in the Arctic Basin, which is caused by enhanced local evaporation or moisture
transport from mid-latitudes (Luo et al., 2017). Positive anomalies of longwave flux in spring and early summer
initiate an earlier melt onset, thereby triggering several feedback mechanisms which amplify melt during the
succeeding months (Kapsch et al., 2016; Huang et al., 2019b). The sea ice melt increases the air temperature

atmospheric processes with changes in Arctic sea ice. Therefore, in this study, we target to provide a more
comprehensive analysis about causality between multiple atmospheric processes and sea ice by applying different
data-driven causality approaches.

According to the context, the influence of precipitation on Arctic sea ice variations is represented by arrow i in Figure 1. It states that the magnitude of precipitation accumulating over the sea ice pack largely determines the depth of the snow layer, which modulates the rate of sea ice growth due to its highly insulating properties. Additionally, rain falling on the sea ice pack can melt, compact, and densify the snowpack, reducing the surface albedo and promoting sea ice melt.

Based on this information, we can conclude that total cloud cover (CC) indirectly affects total precipitation (Precip) through its influence on the accumulation and phase of precipitation over the sea ice pack.

Huang et al. Arctic Sea Ice Causality Discovery surface. The downward shortwave flux, however, appears only
important after the melt has started (Kapsch et al., 2013; Huang et al., 2017). Once the surface albedo is
significantly reduced due to sea ice melt, the solar radiation could be absorbed by ocean, which further
accelerates ice melt in late spring and summer (Kay and Gettelman, 2009; Choi et al., 2014; Kapsch et al., 2016).
The feedback between surface net shortwave flux and sea ice, represented by arrow f in Figure 1, has been
confirmed by both model simulations (Kapsch et al., 2016) and satellite observations (Kay and Gettelman, 2009;
Nussbaumer and Pinker, 2012; Choi et al., 2014). The arrows g indicate the interactions between the sea ice variations
and atmospheric dynamical processes. A series of studies demonstrated that recent loss of Arctic sea ice is triggered
by the atmospheric circulation changes such as a tendency toward a dipole pattern in the mean sea level pressure trend
with an increase over the Arctic Ocean and a decrease over Siberia. The Arctic dipole anomaly in summer
(Wang et al., 2009), winter (Watanabe et al., 2006) and spring (Kapsch et al., 2019) produces a strong meridional
wind (v-component) anomaly that drives more sea ice out of the Arctic Ocean. In addition, this dipole anomaly promotes
transport of heat and moisture and thus enhances downward longwave radiation and control the melt onset
(Huang et al., 2019b; Kapsch et al., 2019). Moreover, the changes in cyclone occurrence and/or depth during spring
(Screen et al., 2011) and summer (Simmonds and Rudeva, 2012) have preconditioning effects on the sea ice cover and
exert a strong influence on the amount of sea ice that survives the melt season. A recent study also pointed out that
a stronger anticyclonic circulation over Greenland and the Arctic Ocean in the troposphere may have contributed as much
as 60% to the September sea ice extent decline since 1979, by warming and moistening the lower atmosphere

These conclusions are mainly drawn from in-situ measurements during field campaign (Perovich et al., 2002; Sturm et al.,
2002), global reanalysis products and surface observations (Screen and Simmonds, 2012; Boisvert et al., 2018;
Wang et al., 2019). The higher precipitation and snowfall could result in a thicker snowpack that allows less heat
loss to the atmosphere. More importantly, modeling studies suggest that increases in Arctic precipitation over the
21st century, particularly in late autumn and winter, are due mainly to strongly intensified local surface evaporation
(latent heat flux) (Bintanja and Selten, 2014). Therefore, we believe that Arctic precipitation exerts direct influence
on sea ice variations (arrow i), while sea ice modulates precipitation mainly through sensible plus latent heat flux
(arrows h, b). Among these studies, very few of them have demonstrated the delayed impact of one variable on another.
Specifically, the net shortwave flux at the surface in early summer (Mayâ€“July) is found to enhance sea ice melt with a
lag of 1â€“4 months (Choi et al., 2014). Moreover, the sea ice condition exhibits the delayed impacts on itself, which is
called sea ice anomaly persistence (Guemas et al., 2016; Cruz-GarcÃ­a et al., 2019; Holland et al., 2019). The sea ice
anomaly persistence depends on the predictand (area, extent, volume), region, and the initial and target dates, which
can be varied from a few days to a few years (Guemas et al., 2016). With sea ice anomaly persistence,
there is predictability for the sea ice area in winter but low predictability throughout the rest of the year in
peripheral seas. Based on multiple model simulations, the Labrador Sea stands out among the considered regions,
with sea ice predictability extending up to 1.5 years (Cruz-GarcÃ­a et al., 2019). Note that most of studies mentioned

Huang et al. Arctic Sea Ice Causality Discovery circulation patterns in the following autumn through the additional
heat stored in the Arctic Ocean and released to the atmosphere during the autumn (Overland and Wang, 2010). The
increased 1,000â€“500 hPa thickness in autumn produce anomalous easterley zonal wind component (u-component), especially
over the north of Alaska and Canada. Moreover, a more meridional flow pattern associated with sea ice reduction have
an impact on the mid-latitude weather (Overland and Wang, 2010). These conclusions are mainly drawn from model
simulations (Watanabe et al., 2006; Rinke et al., 2019), reanalysis and observations (Wang et al., 2009; Overland and
Wang, 2010; Kapsch et al., 2019). In addition to radiation, the sensible plus latent heat flux also plays an important
role in the Arctic energy budget. The increase in the downward moisture flux triggers the melting of the sea ice in
spring (Boisvert et al., 2015; Boisvert and Stroeve, 2015; Marcovecchio et al., 2021). Earlier melt onset and loss of
sea ice in the spring enhance warming of the ice-free ocean surface, which in turn leads to an increase of evaporation
from the surface into the atmosphere in the autumn. This positive feedback between heat flux and sea ice, indicated

simulations (Huang et al., 2019a) during most months of the year. The arrow i represents the influence of precipitation
on Arctic sea ice variations. Specifically, the magnitude of precipitation accumulating over the sea ice pack largely
determines the depth of the snow layer, which modulates the rate of sea ice growth because of its highly insulating
properties (Sturm et al., 2002). The phase of the precipitation falling on the sea ice pack is also important. As rain,
it can melt, compact, and densify the snowpack, thus reducing the surface albedo and promoting sea ice melt (Perovich
et al., 2002).The recent snowfall decline in summer is essentially caused by changes in precipitation form (snow
turning to rain) with very little influence of decreases in total precipitation, which is a result of
lower-atmospheric warming. Then the loss of snow-on-ice results in a substantial decrease in the surface albedo over
the Arctic Ocean, causing additional surface ice melt by absorbing more solar radiation (Screen and Simmonds, 2012).

CAUSALITY BETWEEN ATMOSPHERIC PROCESSES AND ARCTIC SEA ICE VARIATIONS
Due to the two-way interactions between the atmosphere and sea ice, studying causality between them is a challenging but
important task, which makes it an area of high interest within polar climate community. The sea ice variations can be
caused by different dynamical and thermodynamical processes. Important dynamical processes include anomalous surface
wind (Spreen et al., 2011; Wu et al., 2012), regional atmospheric circulation patterns (Overland and Wang, 2010;
Screen et al., 2018; Rinke et al., 2019) and abnormal storm activities (Simmonds et al., 2008; Simmonds and Keay, 2009;
Screen et al., 2011; Simmonds and Rudeva, 2012; Parkinson and Comiso, 2013; Simmonds and Rudeva, 2014). Cloud (Kapsch
et al., 2013), radiation (Kay and Gettelman, 2009; Choi et al., 2014) and precipitation (Boisvert et al., 2018; Wang
et al., 2019; Marcovecchio et al., 2021) are the important thermodynamic factors controlling Arctic sea ice trends
and variability. On the other hand, sea ice decline in turn exerts large influence on the atmosphere, including
cloud (Kay and Gettelman, 2009; Morrison et al., 2018), surface energy budget (Semmler et al., 2012; Boisvert et al.,
2015; Boisvert and Stroeve, 2015), precipitation (Bintanja and Selten, 2014; Kopec et al., 2016) and large-scale
circulation (Chemke et al., 2019; Kennel and Yulaeva, 2020). Figure 1 depicts the causal relations between key
atmospheric variables and sea ice over the Arctic. The sea ice here represents sea ice coverage and/or sea ice
thickness. Note that the processes a âˆ’ d are well-known atmospheric processes, including cloud microphysics,
thermodynamics, radiation, climate dynamics, which have been studied over the past few decades. The processes
e âˆ’ i are summarized from more recent publications, which are still under investigation by climate scientists.
We will explain processes e âˆ’ i in details in the next paragraph. The arrow e represents the two-way effect between
sea ice and net longwave flux at the surface. Based on global reanalysis (Kapsch et al., 2013; Lee et al., 2017),
surface (Cox et al., 2016) and satellite observations (Huang et al., 2017), as well as model simulations (Kapsch et
al., 2016; Huang et al., 2019a), the downward longwave radiation at the surface dominates surface warming and
therefore enhances sea ice melt in winter and spring. The increase in downward longwave flux is a result of an
increase in cloudiness and moisture in the Arctic Basin, which is caused by enhanced local evaporation or moisture
transport from mid-latitudes (Luo et al., 2017). Positive anomalies of longwave flux in spring and early summer
initiate an earlier melt onset, thereby triggering several feedback mechanisms which amplify melt during the
succeeding months (Kapsch et al., 2016; Huang et al., 2019b). The sea ice melt increases the air temperature

atmospheric processes with changes in Arctic sea ice. Therefore, in this study, we target to provide a more
comprehensive analysis about causality between multiple atmospheric processes and sea ice by applying different
data-driven causality approaches.

Huang et al. Arctic Sea Ice Causality Discovery surface. The downward shortwave flux, however, appears only
important after the melt has started (Kapsch et al., 2013; Huang et al., 2017). Once the surface albedo is
significantly reduced due to sea ice melt, the solar radiation could be absorbed by ocean, which further
accelerates ice melt in late spring and summer (Kay and Gettelman, 2009; Choi et al., 2014; Kapsch et al., 2016).
The feedback between surface net shortwave flux and sea ice, represented by arrow f in Figure 1, has been
confirmed by both model simulations (Kapsch et al., 2016) and satellite observations (Kay and Gettelman, 2009;
Nussbaumer and Pinker, 2012; Choi et al., 2014). The arrows g indicate the interactions between the sea ice variations
and atmospheric dynamical processes. A series of studies demonstrated that recent loss of Arctic sea ice is triggered
by the atmospheric circulation changes such as a tendency toward a dipole pattern in the mean sea level pressure trend
with an increase over the Arctic Ocean and a decrease over Siberia. The Arctic dipole anomaly in summer
(Wang et al., 2009), winter (Watanabe et al., 2006) and spring (Kapsch et al., 2019) produces a strong meridional
wind (v-component) anomaly that drives more sea ice out of the Arctic Ocean. In addition, this dipole anomaly promotes
transport of heat and moisture and thus enhances downward longwave radiation and control the melt onset
(Huang et al., 2019b; Kapsch et al., 2019). Moreover, the changes in cyclone occurrence and/or depth during spring
(Screen et al., 2011) and summer (Simmonds and Rudeva, 2012) have preconditioning effects on the sea ice cover and
exert a strong influence on the amount of sea ice that survives the melt season. A recent study also pointed out that
a stronger anticyclonic circulation over Greenland and the Arctic Ocean in the troposphere may have contributed as much
as 60% to the September sea ice extent decline since 1979, by warming and moistening the lower atmosphere

These conclusions are mainly drawn from in-situ measurements during field campaign (Perovich et al., 2002; Sturm et al.,
2002), global reanalysis products and surface observations (Screen and Simmonds, 2012; Boisvert et al., 2018;
Wang et al., 2019). The higher precipitation and snowfall could result in a thicker snowpack that allows less heat
loss to the atmosphere. More importantly, modeling studies suggest that increases in Arctic precipitation over the
21st century, particularly in late autumn and winter, are due mainly to strongly intensified local surface evaporation
(latent heat flux) (Bintanja and Selten, 2014). Therefore, we believe that Arctic precipitation exerts direct influence
on sea ice variations (arrow i), while sea ice modulates precipitation mainly through sensible plus latent heat flux
(arrows h, b). Among these studies, very few of them have demonstrated the delayed impact of one variable on another.
Specifically, the net shortwave flux at the surface in early summer (Mayâ€“July) is found to enhance sea ice melt with a
lag of 1â€“4 months (Choi et al., 2014). Moreover, the sea ice condition exhibits the delayed impacts on itself, which is
called sea ice anomaly persistence (Guemas et al., 2016; Cruz-GarcÃ­a et al., 2019; Holland et al., 2019). The sea ice
anomaly persistence depends on the predictand (area, extent, volume), region, and the initial and target dates, which
can be varied from a few days to a few years (Guemas et al., 2016). With sea ice anomaly persistence,
there is predictability for the sea ice area in winter but low predictability throughout the rest of the year in
peripheral seas. Based on multiple model simulations, the Labrador Sea stands out among the considered regions,
with sea ice predictability extending up to 1.5 years (Cruz-GarcÃ­a et al., 2019). Note that most of studies mentioned
above determine the changes in one variable, happening before another one, by applying time series analysis and/or
composite analysis based on observations, reanalysis or model output (Perovich et al., 2002; Sturm et al., 2002; Kay
and Gettelman, 2009; Wang et al., 2009; Nussbaumer and Pinker, 2012; Kapsch et al., 2013; Choi et al., 2014; Boisvert
et al., 2015; Boisvert and Stroeve, 2015; Cox et al., 2016; Huang et al., 2017; Huang et al., 2019b; Boisvert et al.,
2018; Wang et al., 2019). Among them, some studies use more advanced statistical analysis such as empirical orthogonal
function (Watanabe et al., 2006; Overland and Wang, 2010) and self-organizing map (Kapsch et al., 2019; Rinke et al.,
2019). Other studies assess the causal links through targeted modeling experiments (Bintanja and Selten, 2014; Kapsch
et al., 2016; Ding et al., 2017; Huang et al., 2019a; Cruz-GarcÃ­a et al., 2019), in order to test whether a manipulation
of one variable has an impact on others. And most of the studies focus on relationships between only one or two

(Ding et al., 2017; Huang et al., 2021; Luo et al., 2021). On the other hand, the reduction in Arctic sea ice extent
and increase in open water area in late summer are found to directly contribute to a modification of large-scale

Huang et al. Arctic Sea Ice Causality Discovery circulation patterns in the following autumn through the additional
heat stored in the Arctic Ocean and released to the atmosphere during the autumn (Overland and Wang, 2010). The
increased 1,000â€“500 hPa thickness in autumn produce anomalous easterley zonal wind component (u-component), especially
over the north of Alaska and Canada. Moreover, a more meridional flow pattern associated with sea ice reduction have
an impact on the mid-latitude weather (Overland and Wang, 2010). These conclusions are mainly drawn from model
simulations (Watanabe et al., 2006; Rinke et al., 2019), reanalysis and observations (Wang et al., 2009; Overland and
Wang, 2010; Kapsch et al., 2019). In addition to radiation, the sensible plus latent heat flux also plays an important
role in the Arctic energy budget. The increase in the downward moisture flux triggers the melting of the sea ice in
spring (Boisvert et al., 2015; Boisvert and Stroeve, 2015; Marcovecchio et al., 2021). Earlier melt onset and loss of
sea ice in the spring enhance warming of the ice-free ocean surface, which in turn leads to an increase of evaporation
from the surface into the atmosphere in the autumn. This positive feedback between heat flux and sea ice, indicated
by arrow h, has been confirmed by satellite observations (Boisvert et al., 2015; Boisvert and Stroeve, 2015) and model
simulations (Huang et al., 2019a) during most months of the year. The arrow i represents the influence of precipitation
on Arctic sea ice variations. Specifically, the magnitude of precipitation accumulating over the sea ice pack largely
determines the depth of the snow layer, which modulates the rate of sea ice growth because of its highly insulating

initiate an earlier melt onset, thereby triggering several feedback mechanisms which amplify melt during the
succeeding months (Kapsch et al., 2016; Huang et al., 2019b). The sea ice melt increases the air temperature

119,"To determine if total cloud cover (CC) is a direct cause of sea ice coverage and/or sea ice thickness (sea_ice), we need to analyze the information provided in the context.

According to the context, cloud (CC), radiation, and precipitation are important thermodynamic factors controlling Arctic sea ice trends and variability. The context also mentions that sea ice decline exerts a large influence on the atmosphere, including cloud, surface energy budget, precipitation, and large-scale circulation.

Based on this information, we can infer that there is a two-way interaction between cloud cover and sea ice. Cloud cover can affect sea ice through its impact on radiation and precipitation. On the other hand, sea ice decline can influence cloud cover through changes in the surface energy budget.

Therefore, total cloud cover (CC) can be considered as a contributing factor to sea ice coverage and/or sea ice thickness, but it is not a direct cause. It is influenced by other atmospheric processes and interacts with sea ice in a complex manner.

Huang et al. Arctic Sea Ice Causality Discovery surface. The downward shortwave flux, however, appears only
important after the melt has started (Kapsch et al., 2013; Huang et al., 2017). Once the surface albedo is
significantly reduced due to sea ice melt, the solar radiation could be absorbed by ocean, which further
accelerates ice melt in late spring and summer (Kay and Gettelman, 2009; Choi et al., 2014; Kapsch et al., 2016).
The feedback between surface net shortwave flux and sea ice, represented by arrow f in Figure 1, has been
confirmed by both model simulations (Kapsch et al., 2016) and satellite observations (Kay and Gettelman, 2009;
Nussbaumer and Pinker, 2012; Choi et al., 2014). The arrows g indicate the interactions between the sea ice variations
and atmospheric dynamical processes. A series of studies demonstrated that recent loss of Arctic sea ice is triggered
by the atmospheric circulation changes such as a tendency toward a dipole pattern in the mean sea level pressure trend
with an increase over the Arctic Ocean and a decrease over Siberia. The Arctic dipole anomaly in summer
(Wang et al., 2009), winter (Watanabe et al., 2006) and spring (Kapsch et al., 2019) produces a strong meridional
wind (v-component) anomaly that drives more sea ice out of the Arctic Ocean. In addition, this dipole anomaly promotes
transport of heat and moisture and thus enhances downward longwave radiation and control the melt onset
(Huang et al., 2019b; Kapsch et al., 2019). Moreover, the changes in cyclone occurrence and/or depth during spring
(Screen et al., 2011) and summer (Simmonds and Rudeva, 2012) have preconditioning effects on the sea ice cover and
exert a strong influence on the amount of sea ice that survives the melt season. A recent study also pointed out that
a stronger anticyclonic circulation over Greenland and the Arctic Ocean in the troposphere may have contributed as much
as 60% to the September sea ice extent decline since 1979, by warming and moistening the lower atmosphere

These conclusions are mainly drawn from in-situ measurements during field campaign (Perovich et al., 2002; Sturm et al.,
2002), global reanalysis products and surface observations (Screen and Simmonds, 2012; Boisvert et al., 2018;
Wang et al., 2019). The higher precipitation and snowfall could result in a thicker snowpack that allows less heat
loss to the atmosphere. More importantly, modeling studies suggest that increases in Arctic precipitation over the
21st century, particularly in late autumn and winter, are due mainly to strongly intensified local surface evaporation
(latent heat flux) (Bintanja and Selten, 2014). Therefore, we believe that Arctic precipitation exerts direct influence
on sea ice variations (arrow i), while sea ice modulates precipitation mainly through sensible plus latent heat flux
(arrows h, b). Among these studies, very few of them have demonstrated the delayed impact of one variable on another.
Specifically, the net shortwave flux at the surface in early summer (Mayâ€“July) is found to enhance sea ice melt with a
lag of 1â€“4 months (Choi et al., 2014). Moreover, the sea ice condition exhibits the delayed impacts on itself, which is
called sea ice anomaly persistence (Guemas et al., 2016; Cruz-GarcÃ­a et al., 2019; Holland et al., 2019). The sea ice
anomaly persistence depends on the predictand (area, extent, volume), region, and the initial and target dates, which
can be varied from a few days to a few years (Guemas et al., 2016). With sea ice anomaly persistence,
there is predictability for the sea ice area in winter but low predictability throughout the rest of the year in
peripheral seas. Based on multiple model simulations, the Labrador Sea stands out among the considered regions,
with sea ice predictability extending up to 1.5 years (Cruz-GarcÃ­a et al., 2019). Note that most of studies mentioned
above determine the changes in one variable, happening before another one, by applying time series analysis and/or
composite analysis based on observations, reanalysis or model output (Perovich et al., 2002; Sturm et al., 2002; Kay
and Gettelman, 2009; Wang et al., 2009; Nussbaumer and Pinker, 2012; Kapsch et al., 2013; Choi et al., 2014; Boisvert

2018; Wang et al., 2019). Among them, some studies use more advanced statistical analysis such as empirical orthogonal
function (Watanabe et al., 2006; Overland and Wang, 2010) and self-organizing map (Kapsch et al., 2019; Rinke et al.,
2019). Other studies assess the causal links through targeted modeling experiments (Bintanja and Selten, 2014; Kapsch
et al., 2016; Ding et al., 2017; Huang et al., 2019a; Cruz-GarcÃ­a et al., 2019), in order to test whether a manipulation
of one variable has an impact on others. And most of the studies focus on relationships between only one or two

(Ding et al., 2017; Huang et al., 2021; Luo et al., 2021). On the other hand, the reduction in Arctic sea ice extent
and increase in open water area in late summer are found to directly contribute to a modification of large-scale

Huang et al. Arctic Sea Ice Causality Discovery circulation patterns in the following autumn through the additional
heat stored in the Arctic Ocean and released to the atmosphere during the autumn (Overland and Wang, 2010). The
increased 1,000â€“500 hPa thickness in autumn produce anomalous easterley zonal wind component (u-component), especially
over the north of Alaska and Canada. Moreover, a more meridional flow pattern associated with sea ice reduction have
an impact on the mid-latitude weather (Overland and Wang, 2010). These conclusions are mainly drawn from model
simulations (Watanabe et al., 2006; Rinke et al., 2019), reanalysis and observations (Wang et al., 2009; Overland and
Wang, 2010; Kapsch et al., 2019). In addition to radiation, the sensible plus latent heat flux also plays an important
role in the Arctic energy budget. The increase in the downward moisture flux triggers the melting of the sea ice in
spring (Boisvert et al., 2015; Boisvert and Stroeve, 2015; Marcovecchio et al., 2021). Earlier melt onset and loss of
sea ice in the spring enhance warming of the ice-free ocean surface, which in turn leads to an increase of evaporation
from the surface into the atmosphere in the autumn. This positive feedback between heat flux and sea ice, indicated
by arrow h, has been confirmed by satellite observations (Boisvert et al., 2015; Boisvert and Stroeve, 2015) and model
simulations (Huang et al., 2019a) during most months of the year. The arrow i represents the influence of precipitation
on Arctic sea ice variations. Specifically, the magnitude of precipitation accumulating over the sea ice pack largely
determines the depth of the snow layer, which modulates the rate of sea ice growth because of its highly insulating
properties (Sturm et al., 2002). The phase of the precipitation falling on the sea ice pack is also important. As rain,
it can melt, compact, and densify the snowpack, thus reducing the surface albedo and promoting sea ice melt (Perovich
et al., 2002).The recent snowfall decline in summer is essentially caused by changes in precipitation form (snow
turning to rain) with very little influence of decreases in total precipitation, which is a result of
lower-atmospheric warming. Then the loss of snow-on-ice results in a substantial decrease in the surface albedo over
the Arctic Ocean, causing additional surface ice melt by absorbing more solar radiation (Screen and Simmonds, 2012).

CAUSALITY BETWEEN ATMOSPHERIC PROCESSES AND ARCTIC SEA ICE VARIATIONS
Due to the two-way interactions between the atmosphere and sea ice, studying causality between them is a challenging but
important task, which makes it an area of high interest within polar climate community. The sea ice variations can be
caused by different dynamical and thermodynamical processes. Important dynamical processes include anomalous surface
wind (Spreen et al., 2011; Wu et al., 2012), regional atmospheric circulation patterns (Overland and Wang, 2010;
Screen et al., 2018; Rinke et al., 2019) and abnormal storm activities (Simmonds et al., 2008; Simmonds and Keay, 2009;
Screen et al., 2011; Simmonds and Rudeva, 2012; Parkinson and Comiso, 2013; Simmonds and Rudeva, 2014). Cloud (Kapsch
et al., 2013), radiation (Kay and Gettelman, 2009; Choi et al., 2014) and precipitation (Boisvert et al., 2018; Wang
et al., 2019; Marcovecchio et al., 2021) are the important thermodynamic factors controlling Arctic sea ice trends
and variability. On the other hand, sea ice decline in turn exerts large influence on the atmosphere, including
cloud (Kay and Gettelman, 2009; Morrison et al., 2018), surface energy budget (Semmler et al., 2012; Boisvert et al.,
2015; Boisvert and Stroeve, 2015), precipitation (Bintanja and Selten, 2014; Kopec et al., 2016) and large-scale
circulation (Chemke et al., 2019; Kennel and Yulaeva, 2020). Figure 1 depicts the causal relations between key
atmospheric variables and sea ice over the Arctic. The sea ice here represents sea ice coverage and/or sea ice
thickness. Note that the processes a âˆ’ d are well-known atmospheric processes, including cloud microphysics,
thermodynamics, radiation, climate dynamics, which have been studied over the past few decades. The processes
e âˆ’ i are summarized from more recent publications, which are still under investigation by climate scientists.
We will explain processes e âˆ’ i in details in the next paragraph. The arrow e represents the two-way effect between
sea ice and net longwave flux at the surface. Based on global reanalysis (Kapsch et al., 2013; Lee et al., 2017),
surface (Cox et al., 2016) and satellite observations (Huang et al., 2017), as well as model simulations (Kapsch et
al., 2016; Huang et al., 2019a), the downward longwave radiation at the surface dominates surface warming and
therefore enhances sea ice melt in winter and spring. The increase in downward longwave flux is a result of an
increase in cloudiness and moisture in the Arctic Basin, which is caused by enhanced local evaporation or moisture
transport from mid-latitudes (Luo et al., 2017). Positive anomalies of longwave flux in spring and early summer

confirmed by both model simulations (Kapsch et al., 2016) and satellite observations (Kay and Gettelman, 2009;
Nussbaumer and Pinker, 2012; Choi et al., 2014). The arrows g indicate the interactions between the sea ice variations
and atmospheric dynamical processes. A series of studies demonstrated that recent loss of Arctic sea ice is triggered
by the atmospheric circulation changes such as a tendency toward a dipole pattern in the mean sea level pressure trend
with an increase over the Arctic Ocean and a decrease over Siberia. The Arctic dipole anomaly in summer
(Wang et al., 2009), winter (Watanabe et al., 2006) and spring (Kapsch et al., 2019) produces a strong meridional
wind (v-component) anomaly that drives more sea ice out of the Arctic Ocean. In addition, this dipole anomaly promotes
transport of heat and moisture and thus enhances downward longwave radiation and control the melt onset
(Huang et al., 2019b; Kapsch et al., 2019). Moreover, the changes in cyclone occurrence and/or depth during spring
(Screen et al., 2011) and summer (Simmonds and Rudeva, 2012) have preconditioning effects on the sea ice cover and
exert a strong influence on the amount of sea ice that survives the melt season. A recent study also pointed out that
a stronger anticyclonic circulation over Greenland and the Arctic Ocean in the troposphere may have contributed as much
as 60% to the September sea ice extent decline since 1979, by warming and moistening the lower atmosphere

These conclusions are mainly drawn from in-situ measurements during field campaign (Perovich et al., 2002; Sturm et al.,
2002), global reanalysis products and surface observations (Screen and Simmonds, 2012; Boisvert et al., 2018;
Wang et al., 2019). The higher precipitation and snowfall could result in a thicker snowpack that allows less heat
loss to the atmosphere. More importantly, modeling studies suggest that increases in Arctic precipitation over the
21st century, particularly in late autumn and winter, are due mainly to strongly intensified local surface evaporation
(latent heat flux) (Bintanja and Selten, 2014). Therefore, we believe that Arctic precipitation exerts direct influence
on sea ice variations (arrow i), while sea ice modulates precipitation mainly through sensible plus latent heat flux
(arrows h, b). Among these studies, very few of them have demonstrated the delayed impact of one variable on another.
Specifically, the net shortwave flux at the surface in early summer (Mayâ€“July) is found to enhance sea ice melt with a
lag of 1â€“4 months (Choi et al., 2014). Moreover, the sea ice condition exhibits the delayed impacts on itself, which is
called sea ice anomaly persistence (Guemas et al., 2016; Cruz-GarcÃ­a et al., 2019; Holland et al., 2019). The sea ice
anomaly persistence depends on the predictand (area, extent, volume), region, and the initial and target dates, which
can be varied from a few days to a few years (Guemas et al., 2016). With sea ice anomaly persistence,
there is predictability for the sea ice area in winter but low predictability throughout the rest of the year in
peripheral seas. Based on multiple model simulations, the Labrador Sea stands out among the considered regions,
with sea ice predictability extending up to 1.5 years (Cruz-GarcÃ­a et al., 2019). Note that most of studies mentioned
above determine the changes in one variable, happening before another one, by applying time series analysis and/or
composite analysis based on observations, reanalysis or model output (Perovich et al., 2002; Sturm et al., 2002; Kay
and Gettelman, 2009; Wang et al., 2009; Nussbaumer and Pinker, 2012; Kapsch et al., 2013; Choi et al., 2014; Boisvert
et al., 2015; Boisvert and Stroeve, 2015; Cox et al., 2016; Huang et al., 2017; Huang et al., 2019b; Boisvert et al.,
2018; Wang et al., 2019). Among them, some studies use more advanced statistical analysis such as empirical orthogonal
function (Watanabe et al., 2006; Overland and Wang, 2010) and self-organizing map (Kapsch et al., 2019; Rinke et al.,
2019). Other studies assess the causal links through targeted modeling experiments (Bintanja and Selten, 2014; Kapsch
et al., 2016; Ding et al., 2017; Huang et al., 2019a; Cruz-GarcÃ­a et al., 2019), in order to test whether a manipulation
of one variable has an impact on others. And most of the studies focus on relationships between only one or two

(Ding et al., 2017; Huang et al., 2021; Luo et al., 2021). On the other hand, the reduction in Arctic sea ice extent
and increase in open water area in late summer are found to directly contribute to a modification of large-scale

Huang et al. Arctic Sea Ice Causality Discovery circulation patterns in the following autumn through the additional
heat stored in the Arctic Ocean and released to the atmosphere during the autumn (Overland and Wang, 2010). The
increased 1,000â€“500 hPa thickness in autumn produce anomalous easterley zonal wind component (u-component), especially
over the north of Alaska and Canada. Moreover, a more meridional flow pattern associated with sea ice reduction have
an impact on the mid-latitude weather (Overland and Wang, 2010). These conclusions are mainly drawn from model
simulations (Watanabe et al., 2006; Rinke et al., 2019), reanalysis and observations (Wang et al., 2009; Overland and
Wang, 2010; Kapsch et al., 2019). In addition to radiation, the sensible plus latent heat flux also plays an important
role in the Arctic energy budget. The increase in the downward moisture flux triggers the melting of the sea ice in
spring (Boisvert et al., 2015; Boisvert and Stroeve, 2015; Marcovecchio et al., 2021). Earlier melt onset and loss of
sea ice in the spring enhance warming of the ice-free ocean surface, which in turn leads to an increase of evaporation
from the surface into the atmosphere in the autumn. This positive feedback between heat flux and sea ice, indicated
by arrow h, has been confirmed by satellite observations (Boisvert et al., 2015; Boisvert and Stroeve, 2015) and model
simulations (Huang et al., 2019a) during most months of the year. The arrow i represents the influence of precipitation
on Arctic sea ice variations. Specifically, the magnitude of precipitation accumulating over the sea ice pack largely
determines the depth of the snow layer, which modulates the rate of sea ice growth because of its highly insulating
properties (Sturm et al., 2002). The phase of the precipitation falling on the sea ice pack is also important. As rain,
it can melt, compact, and densify the snowpack, thus reducing the surface albedo and promoting sea ice melt (Perovich
et al., 2002).The recent snowfall decline in summer is essentially caused by changes in precipitation form (snow
turning to rain) with very little influence of decreases in total precipitation, which is a result of
lower-atmospheric warming. Then the loss of snow-on-ice results in a substantial decrease in the surface albedo over
the Arctic Ocean, causing additional surface ice melt by absorbing more solar radiation (Screen and Simmonds, 2012).

CAUSALITY BETWEEN ATMOSPHERIC PROCESSES AND ARCTIC SEA ICE VARIATIONS
Due to the two-way interactions between the atmosphere and sea ice, studying causality between them is a challenging but
important task, which makes it an area of high interest within polar climate community. The sea ice variations can be
caused by different dynamical and thermodynamical processes. Important dynamical processes include anomalous surface
wind (Spreen et al., 2011; Wu et al., 2012), regional atmospheric circulation patterns (Overland and Wang, 2010;
Screen et al., 2018; Rinke et al., 2019) and abnormal storm activities (Simmonds et al., 2008; Simmonds and Keay, 2009;
Screen et al., 2011; Simmonds and Rudeva, 2012; Parkinson and Comiso, 2013; Simmonds and Rudeva, 2014). Cloud (Kapsch
et al., 2013), radiation (Kay and Gettelman, 2009; Choi et al., 2014) and precipitation (Boisvert et al., 2018; Wang
et al., 2019; Marcovecchio et al., 2021) are the important thermodynamic factors controlling Arctic sea ice trends
and variability. On the other hand, sea ice decline in turn exerts large influence on the atmosphere, including
cloud (Kay and Gettelman, 2009; Morrison et al., 2018), surface energy budget (Semmler et al., 2012; Boisvert et al.,
2015; Boisvert and Stroeve, 2015), precipitation (Bintanja and Selten, 2014; Kopec et al., 2016) and large-scale
circulation (Chemke et al., 2019; Kennel and Yulaeva, 2020). Figure 1 depicts the causal relations between key
atmospheric variables and sea ice over the Arctic. The sea ice here represents sea ice coverage and/or sea ice
thickness. Note that the processes a âˆ’ d are well-known atmospheric processes, including cloud microphysics,
thermodynamics, radiation, climate dynamics, which have been studied over the past few decades. The processes
e âˆ’ i are summarized from more recent publications, which are still under investigation by climate scientists.
We will explain processes e âˆ’ i in details in the next paragraph. The arrow e represents the two-way effect between
sea ice and net longwave flux at the surface. Based on global reanalysis (Kapsch et al., 2013; Lee et al., 2017),
surface (Cox et al., 2016) and satellite observations (Huang et al., 2017), as well as model simulations (Kapsch et
al., 2016; Huang et al., 2019a), the downward longwave radiation at the surface dominates surface warming and
therefore enhances sea ice melt in winter and spring. The increase in downward longwave flux is a result of an
increase in cloudiness and moisture in the Arctic Basin, which is caused by enhanced local evaporation or moisture
transport from mid-latitudes (Luo et al., 2017). Positive anomalies of longwave flux in spring and early summer
initiate an earlier melt onset, thereby triggering several feedback mechanisms which amplify melt during the
succeeding months (Kapsch et al., 2016; Huang et al., 2019b). The sea ice melt increases the air temperature

atmospheric processes with changes in Arctic sea ice. Therefore, in this study, we target to provide a more
comprehensive analysis about causality between multiple atmospheric processes and sea ice by applying different
data-driven causality approaches.

above determine the changes in one variable, happening before another one, by applying time series analysis and/or
composite analysis based on observations, reanalysis or model output (Perovich et al., 2002; Sturm et al., 2002; Kay

2018; Wang et al., 2019). Among them, some studies use more advanced statistical analysis such as empirical orthogonal
function (Watanabe et al., 2006; Overland and Wang, 2010) and self-organizing map (Kapsch et al., 2019; Rinke et al.,
2019). Other studies assess the causal links through targeted modeling experiments (Bintanja and Selten, 2014; Kapsch
et al., 2016; Ding et al., 2017; Huang et al., 2019a; Cruz-GarcÃ­a et al., 2019), in order to test whether a manipulation
of one variable has an impact on others. And most of the studies focus on relationships between only one or two

(Ding et al., 2017; Huang et al., 2021; Luo et al., 2021). On the other hand, the reduction in Arctic sea ice extent
and increase in open water area in late summer are found to directly contribute to a modification of large-scale

Huang et al. Arctic Sea Ice Causality Discovery circulation patterns in the following autumn through the additional
heat stored in the Arctic Ocean and released to the atmosphere during the autumn (Overland and Wang, 2010). The
increased 1,000â€“500 hPa thickness in autumn produce anomalous easterley zonal wind component (u-component), especially
over the north of Alaska and Canada. Moreover, a more meridional flow pattern associated with sea ice reduction have
an impact on the mid-latitude weather (Overland and Wang, 2010). These conclusions are mainly drawn from model
simulations (Watanabe et al., 2006; Rinke et al., 2019), reanalysis and observations (Wang et al., 2009; Overland and
Wang, 2010; Kapsch et al., 2019). In addition to radiation, the sensible plus latent heat flux also plays an important
role in the Arctic energy budget. The increase in the downward moisture flux triggers the melting of the sea ice in
spring (Boisvert et al., 2015; Boisvert and Stroeve, 2015; Marcovecchio et al., 2021). Earlier melt onset and loss of
sea ice in the spring enhance warming of the ice-free ocean surface, which in turn leads to an increase of evaporation
from the surface into the atmosphere in the autumn. This positive feedback between heat flux and sea ice, indicated
by arrow h, has been confirmed by satellite observations (Boisvert et al., 2015; Boisvert and Stroeve, 2015) and model
simulations (Huang et al., 2019a) during most months of the year. The arrow i represents the influence of precipitation
on Arctic sea ice variations. Specifically, the magnitude of precipitation accumulating over the sea ice pack largely
determines the depth of the snow layer, which modulates the rate of sea ice growth because of its highly insulating
properties (Sturm et al., 2002). The phase of the precipitation falling on the sea ice pack is also important. As rain,
it can melt, compact, and densify the snowpack, thus reducing the surface albedo and promoting sea ice melt (Perovich
et al., 2002).The recent snowfall decline in summer is essentially caused by changes in precipitation form (snow
turning to rain) with very little influence of decreases in total precipitation, which is a result of
lower-atmospheric warming. Then the loss of snow-on-ice results in a substantial decrease in the surface albedo over
the Arctic Ocean, causing additional surface ice melt by absorbing more solar radiation (Screen and Simmonds, 2012).

CAUSALITY BETWEEN ATMOSPHERIC PROCESSES AND ARCTIC SEA ICE VARIATIONS
Due to the two-way interactions between the atmosphere and sea ice, studying causality between them is a challenging but
important task, which makes it an area of high interest within polar climate community. The sea ice variations can be
caused by different dynamical and thermodynamical processes. Important dynamical processes include anomalous surface
wind (Spreen et al., 2011; Wu et al., 2012), regional atmospheric circulation patterns (Overland and Wang, 2010;
Screen et al., 2018; Rinke et al., 2019) and abnormal storm activities (Simmonds et al., 2008; Simmonds and Keay, 2009;
Screen et al., 2011; Simmonds and Rudeva, 2012; Parkinson and Comiso, 2013; Simmonds and Rudeva, 2014). Cloud (Kapsch
et al., 2013), radiation (Kay and Gettelman, 2009; Choi et al., 2014) and precipitation (Boisvert et al., 2018; Wang
et al., 2019; Marcovecchio et al., 2021) are the important thermodynamic factors controlling Arctic sea ice trends
and variability. On the other hand, sea ice decline in turn exerts large influence on the atmosphere, including
cloud (Kay and Gettelman, 2009; Morrison et al., 2018), surface energy budget (Semmler et al., 2012; Boisvert et al.,
2015; Boisvert and Stroeve, 2015), precipitation (Bintanja and Selten, 2014; Kopec et al., 2016) and large-scale
circulation (Chemke et al., 2019; Kennel and Yulaeva, 2020). Figure 1 depicts the causal relations between key
atmospheric variables and sea ice over the Arctic. The sea ice here represents sea ice coverage and/or sea ice
thickness. Note that the processes a âˆ’ d are well-known atmospheric processes, including cloud microphysics,
thermodynamics, radiation, climate dynamics, which have been studied over the past few decades. The processes
e âˆ’ i are summarized from more recent publications, which are still under investigation by climate scientists.
We will explain processes e âˆ’ i in details in the next paragraph. The arrow e represents the two-way effect between
sea ice and net longwave flux at the surface. Based on global reanalysis (Kapsch et al., 2013; Lee et al., 2017),
surface (Cox et al., 2016) and satellite observations (Huang et al., 2017), as well as model simulations (Kapsch et
al., 2016; Huang et al., 2019a), the downward longwave radiation at the surface dominates surface warming and
therefore enhances sea ice melt in winter and spring. The increase in downward longwave flux is a result of an
increase in cloudiness and moisture in the Arctic Basin, which is caused by enhanced local evaporation or moisture
transport from mid-latitudes (Luo et al., 2017). Positive anomalies of longwave flux in spring and early summer
initiate an earlier melt onset, thereby triggering several feedback mechanisms which amplify melt during the
succeeding months (Kapsch et al., 2016; Huang et al., 2019b). The sea ice melt increases the air temperature

atmospheric processes with changes in Arctic sea ice. Therefore, in this study, we target to provide a more
comprehensive analysis about causality between multiple atmospheric processes and sea ice by applying different
data-driven causality approaches.

Huang et al. Arctic Sea Ice Causality Discovery surface. The downward shortwave flux, however, appears only
important after the melt has started (Kapsch et al., 2013; Huang et al., 2017). Once the surface albedo is
significantly reduced due to sea ice melt, the solar radiation could be absorbed by ocean, which further
accelerates ice melt in late spring and summer (Kay and Gettelman, 2009; Choi et al., 2014; Kapsch et al., 2016).
The feedback between surface net shortwave flux and sea ice, represented by arrow f in Figure 1, has been
confirmed by both model simulations (Kapsch et al., 2016) and satellite observations (Kay and Gettelman, 2009;
Nussbaumer and Pinker, 2012; Choi et al., 2014). The arrows g indicate the interactions between the sea ice variations
and atmospheric dynamical processes. A series of studies demonstrated that recent loss of Arctic sea ice is triggered
by the atmospheric circulation changes such as a tendency toward a dipole pattern in the mean sea level pressure trend
with an increase over the Arctic Ocean and a decrease over Siberia. The Arctic dipole anomaly in summer
(Wang et al., 2009), winter (Watanabe et al., 2006) and spring (Kapsch et al., 2019) produces a strong meridional
wind (v-component) anomaly that drives more sea ice out of the Arctic Ocean. In addition, this dipole anomaly promotes
transport of heat and moisture and thus enhances downward longwave radiation and control the melt onset
(Huang et al., 2019b; Kapsch et al., 2019). Moreover, the changes in cyclone occurrence and/or depth during spring
(Screen et al., 2011) and summer (Simmonds and Rudeva, 2012) have preconditioning effects on the sea ice cover and
exert a strong influence on the amount of sea ice that survives the melt season. A recent study also pointed out that
a stronger anticyclonic circulation over Greenland and the Arctic Ocean in the troposphere may have contributed as much
as 60% to the September sea ice extent decline since 1979, by warming and moistening the lower atmosphere

These conclusions are mainly drawn from in-situ measurements during field campaign (Perovich et al., 2002; Sturm et al.,
2002), global reanalysis products and surface observations (Screen and Simmonds, 2012; Boisvert et al., 2018;
Wang et al., 2019). The higher precipitation and snowfall could result in a thicker snowpack that allows less heat
loss to the atmosphere. More importantly, modeling studies suggest that increases in Arctic precipitation over the
21st century, particularly in late autumn and winter, are due mainly to strongly intensified local surface evaporation
(latent heat flux) (Bintanja and Selten, 2014). Therefore, we believe that Arctic precipitation exerts direct influence
on sea ice variations (arrow i), while sea ice modulates precipitation mainly through sensible plus latent heat flux
(arrows h, b). Among these studies, very few of them have demonstrated the delayed impact of one variable on another.
Specifically, the net shortwave flux at the surface in early summer (Mayâ€“July) is found to enhance sea ice melt with a
lag of 1â€“4 months (Choi et al., 2014). Moreover, the sea ice condition exhibits the delayed impacts on itself, which is
called sea ice anomaly persistence (Guemas et al., 2016; Cruz-GarcÃ­a et al., 2019; Holland et al., 2019). The sea ice
anomaly persistence depends on the predictand (area, extent, volume), region, and the initial and target dates, which
can be varied from a few days to a few years (Guemas et al., 2016). With sea ice anomaly persistence,
there is predictability for the sea ice area in winter but low predictability throughout the rest of the year in
peripheral seas. Based on multiple model simulations, the Labrador Sea stands out among the considered regions,
with sea ice predictability extending up to 1.5 years (Cruz-GarcÃ­a et al., 2019). Note that most of studies mentioned

increased 1,000â€“500 hPa thickness in autumn produce anomalous easterley zonal wind component (u-component), especially

role in the Arctic energy budget. The increase in the downward moisture flux triggers the melting of the sea ice in
spring (Boisvert et al., 2015; Boisvert and Stroeve, 2015; Marcovecchio et al., 2021). Earlier melt onset and loss of

simulations (Huang et al., 2019a) during most months of the year. The arrow i represents the influence of precipitation
on Arctic sea ice variations. Specifically, the magnitude of precipitation accumulating over the sea ice pack largely
determines the depth of the snow layer, which modulates the rate of sea ice growth because of its highly insulating
properties (Sturm et al., 2002). The phase of the precipitation falling on the sea ice pack is also important. As rain,
it can melt, compact, and densify the snowpack, thus reducing the surface albedo and promoting sea ice melt (Perovich
et al., 2002).The recent snowfall decline in summer is essentially caused by changes in precipitation form (snow
turning to rain) with very little influence of decreases in total precipitation, which is a result of
lower-atmospheric warming. Then the loss of snow-on-ice results in a substantial decrease in the surface albedo over
the Arctic Ocean, causing additional surface ice melt by absorbing more solar radiation (Screen and Simmonds, 2012).

CAUSALITY BETWEEN ATMOSPHERIC PROCESSES AND ARCTIC SEA ICE VARIATIONS
Due to the two-way interactions between the atmosphere and sea ice, studying causality between them is a challenging but
important task, which makes it an area of high interest within polar climate community. The sea ice variations can be
caused by different dynamical and thermodynamical processes. Important dynamical processes include anomalous surface
wind (Spreen et al., 2011; Wu et al., 2012), regional atmospheric circulation patterns (Overland and Wang, 2010;
Screen et al., 2018; Rinke et al., 2019) and abnormal storm activities (Simmonds et al., 2008; Simmonds and Keay, 2009;
Screen et al., 2011; Simmonds and Rudeva, 2012; Parkinson and Comiso, 2013; Simmonds and Rudeva, 2014). Cloud (Kapsch
et al., 2013), radiation (Kay and Gettelman, 2009; Choi et al., 2014) and precipitation (Boisvert et al., 2018; Wang
et al., 2019; Marcovecchio et al., 2021) are the important thermodynamic factors controlling Arctic sea ice trends
and variability. On the other hand, sea ice decline in turn exerts large influence on the atmosphere, including
cloud (Kay and Gettelman, 2009; Morrison et al., 2018), surface energy budget (Semmler et al., 2012; Boisvert et al.,
2015; Boisvert and Stroeve, 2015), precipitation (Bintanja and Selten, 2014; Kopec et al., 2016) and large-scale
circulation (Chemke et al., 2019; Kennel and Yulaeva, 2020). Figure 1 depicts the causal relations between key
atmospheric variables and sea ice over the Arctic. The sea ice here represents sea ice coverage and/or sea ice
thickness. Note that the processes a âˆ’ d are well-known atmospheric processes, including cloud microphysics,
thermodynamics, radiation, climate dynamics, which have been studied over the past few decades. The processes
e âˆ’ i are summarized from more recent publications, which are still under investigation by climate scientists.
We will explain processes e âˆ’ i in details in the next paragraph. The arrow e represents the two-way effect between
sea ice and net longwave flux at the surface. Based on global reanalysis (Kapsch et al., 2013; Lee et al., 2017),
surface (Cox et al., 2016) and satellite observations (Huang et al., 2017), as well as model simulations (Kapsch et
al., 2016; Huang et al., 2019a), the downward longwave radiation at the surface dominates surface warming and
therefore enhances sea ice melt in winter and spring. The increase in downward longwave flux is a result of an
increase in cloudiness and moisture in the Arctic Basin, which is caused by enhanced local evaporation or moisture
transport from mid-latitudes (Luo et al., 2017). Positive anomalies of longwave flux in spring and early summer
initiate an earlier melt onset, thereby triggering several feedback mechanisms which amplify melt during the
succeeding months (Kapsch et al., 2016; Huang et al., 2019b). The sea ice melt increases the air temperature

atmospheric processes with changes in Arctic sea ice. Therefore, in this study, we target to provide a more
comprehensive analysis about causality between multiple atmospheric processes and sea ice by applying different
data-driven causality approaches.

According to the context, the influence of precipitation on Arctic sea ice variations is mentioned. It states that the magnitude of precipitation accumulating over the sea ice pack largely determines the depth of the snow layer, which modulates the rate of sea ice growth because of its highly insulating properties. Additionally, rain falling on the sea ice pack can melt, compact, and densify the snowpack, reducing the surface albedo and promoting sea ice melt.

Based on this information, we can conclude that total cloud water path (CW) indirectly affects total precipitation (Precip) by influencing the amount and phase of precipitation falling on the sea ice pack. Therefore, CW is not a direct cause of Precip.

Huang et al. Arctic Sea Ice Causality Discovery surface. The downward shortwave flux, however, appears only
important after the melt has started (Kapsch et al., 2013; Huang et al., 2017). Once the surface albedo is
significantly reduced due to sea ice melt, the solar radiation could be absorbed by ocean, which further
accelerates ice melt in late spring and summer (Kay and Gettelman, 2009; Choi et al., 2014; Kapsch et al., 2016).
The feedback between surface net shortwave flux and sea ice, represented by arrow f in Figure 1, has been
confirmed by both model simulations (Kapsch et al., 2016) and satellite observations (Kay and Gettelman, 2009;
Nussbaumer and Pinker, 2012; Choi et al., 2014). The arrows g indicate the interactions between the sea ice variations
and atmospheric dynamical processes. A series of studies demonstrated that recent loss of Arctic sea ice is triggered
by the atmospheric circulation changes such as a tendency toward a dipole pattern in the mean sea level pressure trend
with an increase over the Arctic Ocean and a decrease over Siberia. The Arctic dipole anomaly in summer
(Wang et al., 2009), winter (Watanabe et al., 2006) and spring (Kapsch et al., 2019) produces a strong meridional
wind (v-component) anomaly that drives more sea ice out of the Arctic Ocean. In addition, this dipole anomaly promotes
transport of heat and moisture and thus enhances downward longwave radiation and control the melt onset
(Huang et al., 2019b; Kapsch et al., 2019). Moreover, the changes in cyclone occurrence and/or depth during spring
(Screen et al., 2011) and summer (Simmonds and Rudeva, 2012) have preconditioning effects on the sea ice cover and
exert a strong influence on the amount of sea ice that survives the melt season. A recent study also pointed out that
a stronger anticyclonic circulation over Greenland and the Arctic Ocean in the troposphere may have contributed as much
as 60% to the September sea ice extent decline since 1979, by warming and moistening the lower atmosphere

These conclusions are mainly drawn from in-situ measurements during field campaign (Perovich et al., 2002; Sturm et al.,
2002), global reanalysis products and surface observations (Screen and Simmonds, 2012; Boisvert et al., 2018;
Wang et al., 2019). The higher precipitation and snowfall could result in a thicker snowpack that allows less heat
loss to the atmosphere. More importantly, modeling studies suggest that increases in Arctic precipitation over the
21st century, particularly in late autumn and winter, are due mainly to strongly intensified local surface evaporation
(latent heat flux) (Bintanja and Selten, 2014). Therefore, we believe that Arctic precipitation exerts direct influence
on sea ice variations (arrow i), while sea ice modulates precipitation mainly through sensible plus latent heat flux
(arrows h, b). Among these studies, very few of them have demonstrated the delayed impact of one variable on another.
Specifically, the net shortwave flux at the surface in early summer (Mayâ€“July) is found to enhance sea ice melt with a
lag of 1â€“4 months (Choi et al., 2014). Moreover, the sea ice condition exhibits the delayed impacts on itself, which is
called sea ice anomaly persistence (Guemas et al., 2016; Cruz-GarcÃ­a et al., 2019; Holland et al., 2019). The sea ice
anomaly persistence depends on the predictand (area, extent, volume), region, and the initial and target dates, which
can be varied from a few days to a few years (Guemas et al., 2016). With sea ice anomaly persistence,
there is predictability for the sea ice area in winter but low predictability throughout the rest of the year in
peripheral seas. Based on multiple model simulations, the Labrador Sea stands out among the considered regions,
with sea ice predictability extending up to 1.5 years (Cruz-GarcÃ­a et al., 2019). Note that most of studies mentioned
above determine the changes in one variable, happening before another one, by applying time series analysis and/or
composite analysis based on observations, reanalysis or model output (Perovich et al., 2002; Sturm et al., 2002; Kay
and Gettelman, 2009; Wang et al., 2009; Nussbaumer and Pinker, 2012; Kapsch et al., 2013; Choi et al., 2014; Boisvert
et al., 2015; Boisvert and Stroeve, 2015; Cox et al., 2016; Huang et al., 2017; Huang et al., 2019b; Boisvert et al.,
2018; Wang et al., 2019). Among them, some studies use more advanced statistical analysis such as empirical orthogonal
function (Watanabe et al., 2006; Overland and Wang, 2010) and self-organizing map (Kapsch et al., 2019; Rinke et al.,
2019). Other studies assess the causal links through targeted modeling experiments (Bintanja and Selten, 2014; Kapsch
et al., 2016; Ding et al., 2017; Huang et al., 2019a; Cruz-GarcÃ­a et al., 2019), in order to test whether a manipulation
of one variable has an impact on others. And most of the studies focus on relationships between only one or two

(Ding et al., 2017; Huang et al., 2021; Luo et al., 2021). On the other hand, the reduction in Arctic sea ice extent
and increase in open water area in late summer are found to directly contribute to a modification of large-scale

Huang et al. Arctic Sea Ice Causality Discovery circulation patterns in the following autumn through the additional
heat stored in the Arctic Ocean and released to the atmosphere during the autumn (Overland and Wang, 2010). The
increased 1,000â€“500 hPa thickness in autumn produce anomalous easterley zonal wind component (u-component), especially
over the north of Alaska and Canada. Moreover, a more meridional flow pattern associated with sea ice reduction have
an impact on the mid-latitude weather (Overland and Wang, 2010). These conclusions are mainly drawn from model
simulations (Watanabe et al., 2006; Rinke et al., 2019), reanalysis and observations (Wang et al., 2009; Overland and
Wang, 2010; Kapsch et al., 2019). In addition to radiation, the sensible plus latent heat flux also plays an important
role in the Arctic energy budget. The increase in the downward moisture flux triggers the melting of the sea ice in
spring (Boisvert et al., 2015; Boisvert and Stroeve, 2015; Marcovecchio et al., 2021). Earlier melt onset and loss of
sea ice in the spring enhance warming of the ice-free ocean surface, which in turn leads to an increase of evaporation
from the surface into the atmosphere in the autumn. This positive feedback between heat flux and sea ice, indicated
by arrow h, has been confirmed by satellite observations (Boisvert et al., 2015; Boisvert and Stroeve, 2015) and model
simulations (Huang et al., 2019a) during most months of the year. The arrow i represents the influence of precipitation

heat stored in the Arctic Ocean and released to the atmosphere during the autumn (Overland and Wang, 2010). The
increased 1,000â€“500 hPa thickness in autumn produce anomalous easterley zonal wind component (u-component), especially
over the north of Alaska and Canada. Moreover, a more meridional flow pattern associated with sea ice reduction have

role in the Arctic energy budget. The increase in the downward moisture flux triggers the melting of the sea ice in
spring (Boisvert et al., 2015; Boisvert and Stroeve, 2015; Marcovecchio et al., 2021). Earlier melt onset and loss of
sea ice in the spring enhance warming of the ice-free ocean surface, which in turn leads to an increase of evaporation
from the surface into the atmosphere in the autumn. This positive feedback between heat flux and sea ice, indicated
by arrow h, has been confirmed by satellite observations (Boisvert et al., 2015; Boisvert and Stroeve, 2015) and model
simulations (Huang et al., 2019a) during most months of the year. The arrow i represents the influence of precipitation
on Arctic sea ice variations. Specifically, the magnitude of precipitation accumulating over the sea ice pack largely
determines the depth of the snow layer, which modulates the rate of sea ice growth because of its highly insulating
properties (Sturm et al., 2002). The phase of the precipitation falling on the sea ice pack is also important. As rain,
it can melt, compact, and densify the snowpack, thus reducing the surface albedo and promoting sea ice melt (Perovich
et al., 2002).The recent snowfall decline in summer is essentially caused by changes in precipitation form (snow
turning to rain) with very little influence of decreases in total precipitation, which is a result of
lower-atmospheric warming. Then the loss of snow-on-ice results in a substantial decrease in the surface albedo over
the Arctic Ocean, causing additional surface ice melt by absorbing more solar radiation (Screen and Simmonds, 2012).

CAUSALITY BETWEEN ATMOSPHERIC PROCESSES AND ARCTIC SEA ICE VARIATIONS
Due to the two-way interactions between the atmosphere and sea ice, studying causality between them is a challenging but
important task, which makes it an area of high interest within polar climate community. The sea ice variations can be
caused by different dynamical and thermodynamical processes. Important dynamical processes include anomalous surface
wind (Spreen et al., 2011; Wu et al., 2012), regional atmospheric circulation patterns (Overland and Wang, 2010;
Screen et al., 2018; Rinke et al., 2019) and abnormal storm activities (Simmonds et al., 2008; Simmonds and Keay, 2009;
Screen et al., 2011; Simmonds and Rudeva, 2012; Parkinson and Comiso, 2013; Simmonds and Rudeva, 2014). Cloud (Kapsch
et al., 2013), radiation (Kay and Gettelman, 2009; Choi et al., 2014) and precipitation (Boisvert et al., 2018; Wang
et al., 2019; Marcovecchio et al., 2021) are the important thermodynamic factors controlling Arctic sea ice trends
and variability. On the other hand, sea ice decline in turn exerts large influence on the atmosphere, including
cloud (Kay and Gettelman, 2009; Morrison et al., 2018), surface energy budget (Semmler et al., 2012; Boisvert et al.,
2015; Boisvert and Stroeve, 2015), precipitation (Bintanja and Selten, 2014; Kopec et al., 2016) and large-scale
circulation (Chemke et al., 2019; Kennel and Yulaeva, 2020). Figure 1 depicts the causal relations between key
atmospheric variables and sea ice over the Arctic. The sea ice here represents sea ice coverage and/or sea ice
thickness. Note that the processes a âˆ’ d are well-known atmospheric processes, including cloud microphysics,
thermodynamics, radiation, climate dynamics, which have been studied over the past few decades. The processes
e âˆ’ i are summarized from more recent publications, which are still under investigation by climate scientists.
We will explain processes e âˆ’ i in details in the next paragraph. The arrow e represents the two-way effect between
sea ice and net longwave flux at the surface. Based on global reanalysis (Kapsch et al., 2013; Lee et al., 2017),
surface (Cox et al., 2016) and satellite observations (Huang et al., 2017), as well as model simulations (Kapsch et
al., 2016; Huang et al., 2019a), the downward longwave radiation at the surface dominates surface warming and
therefore enhances sea ice melt in winter and spring. The increase in downward longwave flux is a result of an
increase in cloudiness and moisture in the Arctic Basin, which is caused by enhanced local evaporation or moisture
transport from mid-latitudes (Luo et al., 2017). Positive anomalies of longwave flux in spring and early summer
initiate an earlier melt onset, thereby triggering several feedback mechanisms which amplify melt during the
succeeding months (Kapsch et al., 2016; Huang et al., 2019b). The sea ice melt increases the air temperature

atmospheric processes with changes in Arctic sea ice. Therefore, in this study, we target to provide a more
comprehensive analysis about causality between multiple atmospheric processes and sea ice by applying different
data-driven causality approaches.

Huang et al. Arctic Sea Ice Causality Discovery surface. The downward shortwave flux, however, appears only
important after the melt has started (Kapsch et al., 2013; Huang et al., 2017). Once the surface albedo is
significantly reduced due to sea ice melt, the solar radiation could be absorbed by ocean, which further
accelerates ice melt in late spring and summer (Kay and Gettelman, 2009; Choi et al., 2014; Kapsch et al., 2016).
The feedback between surface net shortwave flux and sea ice, represented by arrow f in Figure 1, has been
confirmed by both model simulations (Kapsch et al., 2016) and satellite observations (Kay and Gettelman, 2009;
Nussbaumer and Pinker, 2012; Choi et al., 2014). The arrows g indicate the interactions between the sea ice variations
and atmospheric dynamical processes. A series of studies demonstrated that recent loss of Arctic sea ice is triggered
by the atmospheric circulation changes such as a tendency toward a dipole pattern in the mean sea level pressure trend
with an increase over the Arctic Ocean and a decrease over Siberia. The Arctic dipole anomaly in summer
(Wang et al., 2009), winter (Watanabe et al., 2006) and spring (Kapsch et al., 2019) produces a strong meridional
wind (v-component) anomaly that drives more sea ice out of the Arctic Ocean. In addition, this dipole anomaly promotes
transport of heat and moisture and thus enhances downward longwave radiation and control the melt onset
(Huang et al., 2019b; Kapsch et al., 2019). Moreover, the changes in cyclone occurrence and/or depth during spring
(Screen et al., 2011) and summer (Simmonds and Rudeva, 2012) have preconditioning effects on the sea ice cover and
exert a strong influence on the amount of sea ice that survives the melt season. A recent study also pointed out that
a stronger anticyclonic circulation over Greenland and the Arctic Ocean in the troposphere may have contributed as much
as 60% to the September sea ice extent decline since 1979, by warming and moistening the lower atmosphere

These conclusions are mainly drawn from in-situ measurements during field campaign (Perovich et al., 2002; Sturm et al.,
2002), global reanalysis products and surface observations (Screen and Simmonds, 2012; Boisvert et al., 2018;
Wang et al., 2019). The higher precipitation and snowfall could result in a thicker snowpack that allows less heat
loss to the atmosphere. More importantly, modeling studies suggest that increases in Arctic precipitation over the
21st century, particularly in late autumn and winter, are due mainly to strongly intensified local surface evaporation
(latent heat flux) (Bintanja and Selten, 2014). Therefore, we believe that Arctic precipitation exerts direct influence
on sea ice variations (arrow i), while sea ice modulates precipitation mainly through sensible plus latent heat flux
(arrows h, b). Among these studies, very few of them have demonstrated the delayed impact of one variable on another.
Specifically, the net shortwave flux at the surface in early summer (Mayâ€“July) is found to enhance sea ice melt with a
lag of 1â€“4 months (Choi et al., 2014). Moreover, the sea ice condition exhibits the delayed impacts on itself, which is
called sea ice anomaly persistence (Guemas et al., 2016; Cruz-GarcÃ­a et al., 2019; Holland et al., 2019). The sea ice
anomaly persistence depends on the predictand (area, extent, volume), region, and the initial and target dates, which
can be varied from a few days to a few years (Guemas et al., 2016). With sea ice anomaly persistence,
there is predictability for the sea ice area in winter but low predictability throughout the rest of the year in
peripheral seas. Based on multiple model simulations, the Labrador Sea stands out among the considered regions,
with sea ice predictability extending up to 1.5 years (Cruz-GarcÃ­a et al., 2019). Note that most of studies mentioned
above determine the changes in one variable, happening before another one, by applying time series analysis and/or
composite analysis based on observations, reanalysis or model output (Perovich et al., 2002; Sturm et al., 2002; Kay
and Gettelman, 2009; Wang et al., 2009; Nussbaumer and Pinker, 2012; Kapsch et al., 2013; Choi et al., 2014; Boisvert
et al., 2015; Boisvert and Stroeve, 2015; Cox et al., 2016; Huang et al., 2017; Huang et al., 2019b; Boisvert et al.,
2018; Wang et al., 2019). Among them, some studies use more advanced statistical analysis such as empirical orthogonal
function (Watanabe et al., 2006; Overland and Wang, 2010) and self-organizing map (Kapsch et al., 2019; Rinke et al.,
2019). Other studies assess the causal links through targeted modeling experiments (Bintanja and Selten, 2014; Kapsch
et al., 2016; Ding et al., 2017; Huang et al., 2019a; Cruz-GarcÃ­a et al., 2019), in order to test whether a manipulation
of one variable has an impact on others. And most of the studies focus on relationships between only one or two

(Ding et al., 2017; Huang et al., 2021; Luo et al., 2021). On the other hand, the reduction in Arctic sea ice extent
and increase in open water area in late summer are found to directly contribute to a modification of large-scale

Huang et al. Arctic Sea Ice Causality Discovery circulation patterns in the following autumn through the additional
heat stored in the Arctic Ocean and released to the atmosphere during the autumn (Overland and Wang, 2010). The
increased 1,000â€“500 hPa thickness in autumn produce anomalous easterley zonal wind component (u-component), especially
over the north of Alaska and Canada. Moreover, a more meridional flow pattern associated with sea ice reduction have
an impact on the mid-latitude weather (Overland and Wang, 2010). These conclusions are mainly drawn from model
simulations (Watanabe et al., 2006; Rinke et al., 2019), reanalysis and observations (Wang et al., 2009; Overland and
Wang, 2010; Kapsch et al., 2019). In addition to radiation, the sensible plus latent heat flux also plays an important
role in the Arctic energy budget. The increase in the downward moisture flux triggers the melting of the sea ice in
spring (Boisvert et al., 2015; Boisvert and Stroeve, 2015; Marcovecchio et al., 2021). Earlier melt onset and loss of
sea ice in the spring enhance warming of the ice-free ocean surface, which in turn leads to an increase of evaporation
from the surface into the atmosphere in the autumn. This positive feedback between heat flux and sea ice, indicated
by arrow h, has been confirmed by satellite observations (Boisvert et al., 2015; Boisvert and Stroeve, 2015) and model
simulations (Huang et al., 2019a) during most months of the year. The arrow i represents the influence of precipitation
on Arctic sea ice variations. Specifically, the magnitude of precipitation accumulating over the sea ice pack largely
determines the depth of the snow layer, which modulates the rate of sea ice growth because of its highly insulating
properties (Sturm et al., 2002). The phase of the precipitation falling on the sea ice pack is also important. As rain,
it can melt, compact, and densify the snowpack, thus reducing the surface albedo and promoting sea ice melt (Perovich
et al., 2002).The recent snowfall decline in summer is essentially caused by changes in precipitation form (snow
turning to rain) with very little influence of decreases in total precipitation, which is a result of
lower-atmospheric warming. Then the loss of snow-on-ice results in a substantial decrease in the surface albedo over
the Arctic Ocean, causing additional surface ice melt by absorbing more solar radiation (Screen and Simmonds, 2012).

CAUSALITY BETWEEN ATMOSPHERIC PROCESSES AND ARCTIC SEA ICE VARIATIONS
Due to the two-way interactions between the atmosphere and sea ice, studying causality between them is a challenging but
important task, which makes it an area of high interest within polar climate community. The sea ice variations can be
caused by different dynamical and thermodynamical processes. Important dynamical processes include anomalous surface
wind (Spreen et al., 2011; Wu et al., 2012), regional atmospheric circulation patterns (Overland and Wang, 2010;
Screen et al., 2018; Rinke et al., 2019) and abnormal storm activities (Simmonds et al., 2008; Simmonds and Keay, 2009;
Screen et al., 2011; Simmonds and Rudeva, 2012; Parkinson and Comiso, 2013; Simmonds and Rudeva, 2014). Cloud (Kapsch
et al., 2013), radiation (Kay and Gettelman, 2009; Choi et al., 2014) and precipitation (Boisvert et al., 2018; Wang
et al., 2019; Marcovecchio et al., 2021) are the important thermodynamic factors controlling Arctic sea ice trends
and variability. On the other hand, sea ice decline in turn exerts large influence on the atmosphere, including
cloud (Kay and Gettelman, 2009; Morrison et al., 2018), surface energy budget (Semmler et al., 2012; Boisvert et al.,
2015; Boisvert and Stroeve, 2015), precipitation (Bintanja and Selten, 2014; Kopec et al., 2016) and large-scale
circulation (Chemke et al., 2019; Kennel and Yulaeva, 2020). Figure 1 depicts the causal relations between key
atmospheric variables and sea ice over the Arctic. The sea ice here represents sea ice coverage and/or sea ice
thickness. Note that the processes a âˆ’ d are well-known atmospheric processes, including cloud microphysics,
thermodynamics, radiation, climate dynamics, which have been studied over the past few decades. The processes
e âˆ’ i are summarized from more recent publications, which are still under investigation by climate scientists.
We will explain processes e âˆ’ i in details in the next paragraph. The arrow e represents the two-way effect between
sea ice and net longwave flux at the surface. Based on global reanalysis (Kapsch et al., 2013; Lee et al., 2017),
surface (Cox et al., 2016) and satellite observations (Huang et al., 2017), as well as model simulations (Kapsch et
al., 2016; Huang et al., 2019a), the downward longwave radiation at the surface dominates surface warming and
therefore enhances sea ice melt in winter and spring. The increase in downward longwave flux is a result of an

The feedback between surface net shortwave flux and sea ice, represented by arrow f in Figure 1, has been
confirmed by both model simulations (Kapsch et al., 2016) and satellite observations (Kay and Gettelman, 2009;
Nussbaumer and Pinker, 2012; Choi et al., 2014). The arrows g indicate the interactions between the sea ice variations
and atmospheric dynamical processes. A series of studies demonstrated that recent loss of Arctic sea ice is triggered
by the atmospheric circulation changes such as a tendency toward a dipole pattern in the mean sea level pressure trend
with an increase over the Arctic Ocean and a decrease over Siberia. The Arctic dipole anomaly in summer
(Wang et al., 2009), winter (Watanabe et al., 2006) and spring (Kapsch et al., 2019) produces a strong meridional
wind (v-component) anomaly that drives more sea ice out of the Arctic Ocean. In addition, this dipole anomaly promotes
transport of heat and moisture and thus enhances downward longwave radiation and control the melt onset
(Huang et al., 2019b; Kapsch et al., 2019). Moreover, the changes in cyclone occurrence and/or depth during spring
(Screen et al., 2011) and summer (Simmonds and Rudeva, 2012) have preconditioning effects on the sea ice cover and
exert a strong influence on the amount of sea ice that survives the melt season. A recent study also pointed out that
a stronger anticyclonic circulation over Greenland and the Arctic Ocean in the troposphere may have contributed as much
as 60% to the September sea ice extent decline since 1979, by warming and moistening the lower atmosphere

These conclusions are mainly drawn from in-situ measurements during field campaign (Perovich et al., 2002; Sturm et al.,
2002), global reanalysis products and surface observations (Screen and Simmonds, 2012; Boisvert et al., 2018;
Wang et al., 2019). The higher precipitation and snowfall could result in a thicker snowpack that allows less heat
loss to the atmosphere. More importantly, modeling studies suggest that increases in Arctic precipitation over the
21st century, particularly in late autumn and winter, are due mainly to strongly intensified local surface evaporation
(latent heat flux) (Bintanja and Selten, 2014). Therefore, we believe that Arctic precipitation exerts direct influence
on sea ice variations (arrow i), while sea ice modulates precipitation mainly through sensible plus latent heat flux
(arrows h, b). Among these studies, very few of them have demonstrated the delayed impact of one variable on another.
Specifically, the net shortwave flux at the surface in early summer (Mayâ€“July) is found to enhance sea ice melt with a
lag of 1â€“4 months (Choi et al., 2014). Moreover, the sea ice condition exhibits the delayed impacts on itself, which is
called sea ice anomaly persistence (Guemas et al., 2016; Cruz-GarcÃ­a et al., 2019; Holland et al., 2019). The sea ice
anomaly persistence depends on the predictand (area, extent, volume), region, and the initial and target dates, which
can be varied from a few days to a few years (Guemas et al., 2016). With sea ice anomaly persistence,
there is predictability for the sea ice area in winter but low predictability throughout the rest of the year in
peripheral seas. Based on multiple model simulations, the Labrador Sea stands out among the considered regions,
with sea ice predictability extending up to 1.5 years (Cruz-GarcÃ­a et al., 2019). Note that most of studies mentioned
above determine the changes in one variable, happening before another one, by applying time series analysis and/or
composite analysis based on observations, reanalysis or model output (Perovich et al., 2002; Sturm et al., 2002; Kay
and Gettelman, 2009; Wang et al., 2009; Nussbaumer and Pinker, 2012; Kapsch et al., 2013; Choi et al., 2014; Boisvert
et al., 2015; Boisvert and Stroeve, 2015; Cox et al., 2016; Huang et al., 2017; Huang et al., 2019b; Boisvert et al.,
2018; Wang et al., 2019). Among them, some studies use more advanced statistical analysis such as empirical orthogonal
function (Watanabe et al., 2006; Overland and Wang, 2010) and self-organizing map (Kapsch et al., 2019; Rinke et al.,
2019). Other studies assess the causal links through targeted modeling experiments (Bintanja and Selten, 2014; Kapsch
et al., 2016; Ding et al., 2017; Huang et al., 2019a; Cruz-GarcÃ­a et al., 2019), in order to test whether a manipulation
of one variable has an impact on others. And most of the studies focus on relationships between only one or two

(Ding et al., 2017; Huang et al., 2021; Luo et al., 2021). On the other hand, the reduction in Arctic sea ice extent
and increase in open water area in late summer are found to directly contribute to a modification of large-scale

Huang et al. Arctic Sea Ice Causality Discovery circulation patterns in the following autumn through the additional
heat stored in the Arctic Ocean and released to the atmosphere during the autumn (Overland and Wang, 2010). The
increased 1,000â€“500 hPa thickness in autumn produce anomalous easterley zonal wind component (u-component), especially
over the north of Alaska and Canada. Moreover, a more meridional flow pattern associated with sea ice reduction have
an impact on the mid-latitude weather (Overland and Wang, 2010). These conclusions are mainly drawn from model
simulations (Watanabe et al., 2006; Rinke et al., 2019), reanalysis and observations (Wang et al., 2009; Overland and
Wang, 2010; Kapsch et al., 2019). In addition to radiation, the sensible plus latent heat flux also plays an important
role in the Arctic energy budget. The increase in the downward moisture flux triggers the melting of the sea ice in
spring (Boisvert et al., 2015; Boisvert and Stroeve, 2015; Marcovecchio et al., 2021). Earlier melt onset and loss of
sea ice in the spring enhance warming of the ice-free ocean surface, which in turn leads to an increase of evaporation
from the surface into the atmosphere in the autumn. This positive feedback between heat flux and sea ice, indicated
by arrow h, has been confirmed by satellite observations (Boisvert et al., 2015; Boisvert and Stroeve, 2015) and model
simulations (Huang et al., 2019a) during most months of the year. The arrow i represents the influence of precipitation
on Arctic sea ice variations. Specifically, the magnitude of precipitation accumulating over the sea ice pack largely
determines the depth of the snow layer, which modulates the rate of sea ice growth because of its highly insulating
properties (Sturm et al., 2002). The phase of the precipitation falling on the sea ice pack is also important. As rain,
it can melt, compact, and densify the snowpack, thus reducing the surface albedo and promoting sea ice melt (Perovich
et al., 2002).The recent snowfall decline in summer is essentially caused by changes in precipitation form (snow
turning to rain) with very little influence of decreases in total precipitation, which is a result of
lower-atmospheric warming. Then the loss of snow-on-ice results in a substantial decrease in the surface albedo over
the Arctic Ocean, causing additional surface ice melt by absorbing more solar radiation (Screen and Simmonds, 2012).

CAUSALITY BETWEEN ATMOSPHERIC PROCESSES AND ARCTIC SEA ICE VARIATIONS
Due to the two-way interactions between the atmosphere and sea ice, studying causality between them is a challenging but
important task, which makes it an area of high interest within polar climate community. The sea ice variations can be
caused by different dynamical and thermodynamical processes. Important dynamical processes include anomalous surface
wind (Spreen et al., 2011; Wu et al., 2012), regional atmospheric circulation patterns (Overland and Wang, 2010;
Screen et al., 2018; Rinke et al., 2019) and abnormal storm activities (Simmonds et al., 2008; Simmonds and Keay, 2009;
Screen et al., 2011; Simmonds and Rudeva, 2012; Parkinson and Comiso, 2013; Simmonds and Rudeva, 2014). Cloud (Kapsch
et al., 2013), radiation (Kay and Gettelman, 2009; Choi et al., 2014) and precipitation (Boisvert et al., 2018; Wang
et al., 2019; Marcovecchio et al., 2021) are the important thermodynamic factors controlling Arctic sea ice trends
and variability. On the other hand, sea ice decline in turn exerts large influence on the atmosphere, including
cloud (Kay and Gettelman, 2009; Morrison et al., 2018), surface energy budget (Semmler et al., 2012; Boisvert et al.,
2015; Boisvert and Stroeve, 2015), precipitation (Bintanja and Selten, 2014; Kopec et al., 2016) and large-scale
circulation (Chemke et al., 2019; Kennel and Yulaeva, 2020). Figure 1 depicts the causal relations between key
atmospheric variables and sea ice over the Arctic. The sea ice here represents sea ice coverage and/or sea ice
thickness. Note that the processes a âˆ’ d are well-known atmospheric processes, including cloud microphysics,
thermodynamics, radiation, climate dynamics, which have been studied over the past few decades. The processes
e âˆ’ i are summarized from more recent publications, which are still under investigation by climate scientists.
We will explain processes e âˆ’ i in details in the next paragraph. The arrow e represents the two-way effect between
sea ice and net longwave flux at the surface. Based on global reanalysis (Kapsch et al., 2013; Lee et al., 2017),
surface (Cox et al., 2016) and satellite observations (Huang et al., 2017), as well as model simulations (Kapsch et
al., 2016; Huang et al., 2019a), the downward longwave radiation at the surface dominates surface warming and
therefore enhances sea ice melt in winter and spring. The increase in downward longwave flux is a result of an
increase in cloudiness and moisture in the Arctic Basin, which is caused by enhanced local evaporation or moisture
transport from mid-latitudes (Luo et al., 2017). Positive anomalies of longwave flux in spring and early summer
initiate an earlier melt onset, thereby triggering several feedback mechanisms which amplify melt during the
succeeding months (Kapsch et al., 2016; Huang et al., 2019b). The sea ice melt increases the air temperature

atmospheric processes with changes in Arctic sea ice. Therefore, in this study, we target to provide a more
comprehensive analysis about causality between multiple atmospheric processes and sea ice by applying different
data-driven causality approaches.

important after the melt has started (Kapsch et al., 2013; Huang et al., 2017). Once the surface albedo is
