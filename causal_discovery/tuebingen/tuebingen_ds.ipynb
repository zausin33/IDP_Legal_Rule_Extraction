Ozone plays a crucial role in absorbing most of the Sun's harmful ultraviolet radiation.\\n\\nTemperature, on the other hand, is a measure of the degree of hotness or coldness in the atmosphere.\\n\\nStep 2: Analyzing the Cause and Effect\\n\\nA. Changing Ozone Concentration Causes a Change in Temperature\\n\\nOzone absorbs solar radiation, which warms the surrounding atmosphere and cools the surface of the Earth. Therefore, if the concentration of ozone changes, it could potentially affect the temperature by altering the amount of solar radiation that is absorbed.\\n\\nB. Changing Temperature Causes a Change in Ozone Concentration\\n\\nTemperature can also affect ozone concentration. Warmer temperatures can speed up the chemical reactions that destroy ozone, while colder temperatures can slow these reactions down. Additionally, changes in temperature can affect wind patterns and other atmospheric conditions that can transport ozone around the globe.\\n\\nStep 3: Determining the More Likely Relationship\\n\\nBoth relationships are scientifically plausible. However, the relationship between temperature and ozone concentration is more complex and involves more variables, such as wind patterns and chemical reactions. On the other hand, the relationship between ozone concentration and temperature is more direct, as ozone directly absorbs solar radiation, which affects temperature.\\n\\n<Answer>A</Answer>\",\n 'Both options A and B are essentially the same. They both state that changing the variables Temp (Temperature), Press (Pressure), SLP (Sea Level Pressure), and Rh (Relative Humidity) will cause a change in the same variables Temp, Press, SLP, and Rh. \\n\\nSo, both A and B are equally likely because they are stating the same cause-and-effect relationship.\\n\\n<Answer>Both A and B</Answer>',\n \"Step 1: Identify the entities involved\\nThe entities involved here are Hang Seng Bank and HSBC Holdings, both of which are major banking institutions.\\n\\nStep 2: Understand the relationship between the entities\\nBoth Hang Seng Bank and HSBC Holdings are part of the financial sector, and their stock returns could be influenced by similar factors such as economic conditions, interest rates, and regulatory changes. However, it's important to note that HSBC Holdings is a much larger and more globally diversified bank compared to Hang Seng Bank.\\n\\nStep 3: Analyze the cause-and-effect relationship\\nWhile it's possible that changes in the stock return of one bank could influence the other, it's more likely that a larger, more globally influential bank like HSBC Holdings would have a greater impact on Hang Seng Bank than the other way around. This is because HSBC's performance could be seen as an indicator of the overall health of the banking sector, which could influence investor sentiment towards other banks like Hang Seng.\\n\\nStep 4: Conclusion\\nBased on the above analysis, it's more likely that changing the stock return of HSBC Holdings causes a change in the stock return of Hang Seng Bank.\\n\\n<Answer>B</Answer>\",\n \"To determine which cause-and-effect relationship is more likely, we need to consider the relationship between the two companies, Hutchison and Cheung Kong. \\n\\n1. Hutchison Whampoa Limited and Cheung Kong Holdings are both multinational conglomerates and they are both owned by the same person, Li Ka-shing. \\n\\n2. The performance of these two companies could be interrelated due to their common ownership and potential business interactions. \\n\\n3. However, without specific information about the nature of their relationship, it's difficult to definitively say which company's stock return would cause a change in the other's. \\n\\n4. It's also important to note that stock returns can be influenced by a wide range of factors, including overall market conditions, economic indicators, and company-specific news. \\n\\n5. Therefore, a change in one company's stock return could potentially cause a change in the other's, but it could also be the result of other factors. \\n\\n6. In general, larger and more influential companies are more likely to impact the stock returns of smaller, less influential companies. If one of these companies is significantly larger or more influential than the other, it would be more likely that changes in its stock return would cause changes in the other's.\\n\\nWithout specific information about the size and influence of these two companies, it's difficult to definitively say which cause-and-effect relationship is more likely. \\n\\n<Answer>Insufficient Information</Answer>\",\n \"To determine which cause-and-effect relationship is more likely, we would need to consider several factors such as the market capitalization of the companies, their influence in the market, their business relationship, and the correlation of their stock returns. \\n\\nHowever, without specific information about these factors, it's impossible to definitively say which company's stock return is more likely to influence the other's. \\n\\nIn general, larger companies with more market influence might be more likely to affect the stock returns of smaller companies than vice versa. If Cheung Kong is a larger company with more market influence than Sun Hung Kai Properties, then it might be more likely that changes in Cheung Kong's stock return would cause changes in Sun Hung Kai Properties' stock return, and vice versa if Sun Hung Kai Properties is the larger and more influential company.\\n\\nBut again, without specific information about these companies and their relationship, we can't definitively say which cause-and-effect relationship is more likely.\\n\\n<Answer>Insufficient Information</Answer>\",\n \"Step 1: Understanding the Variables\\nTemperature refers to the degree or intensity of heat present in a substance or object. Local CO2 flux, US-PFa, refers to the amount of carbon dioxide that is being emitted or absorbed in a specific area in the United States.\\n\\nStep 2: Understanding the Relationship\\nCarbon dioxide (CO2) is a greenhouse gas. When the amount of CO2 in the atmosphere increases, it traps more heat from the sun, which can lead to an increase in temperature. This is the basis of global warming and climate change.\\n\\nStep 3: Evaluating the Causes\\nA. Changing Temperature causes a change in Local CO2 flux, US-PFa: While it's true that temperature can affect CO2 flux (for example, warmer temperatures can increase the rate of decomposition of organic matter, which can release more CO2), this is generally a secondary effect. The primary driver of changes in CO2 flux is human activity, such as burning fossil fuels.\\n\\nB. Changing Local CO2 flux, US-PFa causes a change in Temperature: As mentioned above, an increase in CO2 in the atmosphere can trap more heat and lead to an increase in temperature. This is a well-established scientific principle and is the primary way that human activity is driving climate change.\\n\\nStep 4: Final Answer\\nBased on the above analysis, it is more likely that changing Local CO2 flux, US-PFa causes a change in Temperature.\\n\\n<Answer>B</Answer>\",\n 'Step 1: Understanding the question\\nThe question is asking us to determine which cause-and-effect relationship is more likely when it comes to root decomposition in grassland (grassl) in April and October.\\n\\nStep 2: Analyzing the options\\nOption A suggests that changing root decomposition in April causes a change in root decomposition in October. This implies that the state of root decomposition in spring (April) would have an impact on the state of root decomposition in autumn (October).\\n\\nOption B suggests that changing root decomposition in October causes a change in root decomposition in April. This implies that the state of root decomposition in autumn (October) would have an impact on the state of root decomposition in spring (April).\\n\\nStep 3: Drawing a conclusion\\nIn terms of the natural cycle of plant growth and decay, it would be more likely that the state of root decomposition in autumn (October) would have an impact on the state of root decomposition in spring (April). This is because the decomposition that occurs in autumn would likely influence the nutrients available in the soil for plant growth in the following spring.\\n\\nFinal Answer: <Answer>B</Answer>',\n \"Step 1: Understanding the context\\nRoot decomposition is a natural process that occurs in forests, where dead roots break down and return nutrients to the soil. This process is influenced by various factors such as temperature, moisture, and the presence of decomposers like fungi and bacteria.\\n\\nStep 2: Analyzing the cause-and-effect relationships\\nIn option A, we're considering that a change in root decomposition in April causes a change in root decomposition in October. This implies that the conditions or factors affecting decomposition in April have a lasting impact that can be observed in October.\\n\\nIn option B, we're considering that a change in root decomposition in October causes a change in root decomposition in April. This implies that the conditions or factors affecting decomposition in October have a lasting impact that can be observed in April.\\n\\nStep 3: Evaluating the likelihood\\nThe likelihood of either scenario depends on the specific factors causing the change in root decomposition and how long-lasting their effects are. However, considering the general cycle of seasons, changes in April (spring) might have less impact on October (autumn) due to the intervening summer season. On the other hand, changes in October could potentially have a more direct impact on April, as the intervening winter season might preserve the conditions of October to some extent.\\n\\n<Answer>B</Answer>\"]"

      "You experience weather at the Earth's surface, but there is weather high in the atmosphere, too. Have you ever taken a ride in a hot-air balloon or climbed a high mountain? You would know that the air temperature usually decreases with altitude. The basic reason has to do with where the atmosphere receives its heat and where it loses its heat. The Earth's surface is heated by the sun at some times and places. It loses heat to outer space at other times and places. On balance, however, the Earth's surface gains more heat than it loses. The atmosphere near the ground is then heated by the ground. High up in the atmosphere, however, the air loses more heat to space than it absorbs from sunlight. Air pressure decreases with increasing altitude.\n",
      "\n",
      "Many kinds of devices have been invented for measuring things like temperature, pressure, and humidity in the upper atmosphere. These devices, called sondes, are packages of several instruments. Balloons are used to carry them up through the atmosphere. As they rise, they send back measurements by radio. Eventually the balloon pops, and the instruments crash back to Earth. Their fall is not dangerous to humans, because the instruments are very small and light.\n",

      "How Altitude Affects Climate\n",
      "\n",
      "When you live on the coast and travel inland to a region situated at a higher altitude, you quickly realize that the atmospheric conditions change significantly for some reason. The opposite is true as well.\n",
      "\n",
      "A region located at a higher altitude generally experiences colder temperatures and lower air pressures than a region situated at sea level. This is a result of both temperature and air pressure reaching their highest values close to the surface of the Earth and decreasing as altitude increases.\n",
      "\n",
      "At a few thousand feet or higher above sea level, the climate you experience is very different from the climate you will find in a coastal town. It all has to do with how weather elements change with an increase in altitude within the atmosphere.\n",
      "\n",
      "This article examines what causes these changes in weather elements as altitude increase, and also look at the prevailing weather conditions in a location at a high altitude compared to the environment at sea level.\n",
      "\n",
      "A quick word about climate: There are similarities but also significant differences between weather and climate. Weather is the atmospheric condition at any given time at a specific location.\n",
      "\n",
      "Climate, however, is the average atmospheric conditions in a specific location calculated over a prolonged period. (At least 30 years in most cases.) You can read the in-depth article describing the difference between Weather and Climate by following this link.\n",
      "\n",
      "How Does Altitude Affect Climate?\n",
      "\n",
      "Before we look at what the climate conditions are like at a location a few thousand feet above sea level and then contrast it against a similar environment at sea level, one needs to see how an increase in altitude affects the different weather variables:\n",
      "\n",
      "But first, one needs to address the difference between altitude and elevation.\n",
      "\n",
      "Altitude vs. Elevation\n",
      "\n",
      "In meteorology and aviation, altitude generally refers to an object/location's height above sea level. Elevation, though, refers to the height of an object relative to the physical terrain (ground level) beneath it.\n",
      "\n",
      "In aviation, altitude also has a few different meanings. Here is a quick summary:\n",
      "\n",
      "Indicated Altitude: The altitude displayed on the altimeter.\n",
      "\n",
      "Absolute Altitude: The distance between the aircraft and the ground below it.\n",
      "\n",
      "True Altitude: The height of the aircraft above sea level.\n",
      "\n",
      "Height: The vertical distance between the aircraft and a specific point below it.\n",
      "\n",
      "Pressure and Density Altitude also gets used, but it may make things too confusing and is not relevant to the context within which this article uses altitude.\n",
      "\n",
      "For the purpose of this post, altitude will always refer to an object's height above sea level.\n",
      "\n",
      "One can now focus on the different elements and how altitude affects them:\n",
      "\n",
      "How Does Altitude Affect Temperature?\n",
      "\n",
      "The Earth and atmosphere get warmed up as a result of the sun's solar radiation, specifically the infrared component of solar radiation. The infrared radiation warms up the land and oceans, which, in turn, warms up the air in the atmosphere.\n",
      "\n",
      "Since the atmosphere gets warmed up from the bottom up, the air is usually at its warmest at the surface of the planet and cools down as altitude increases.\n",
      "\n",
      "Although local variable conditions will influence the following figures, temperatures usually drop at a rate of 1° Celsius per 100 meters. More broadly put, temperatures fall by 5.4° Fahrenheit per 1 000 feet or 9.8° Celsius every 1 000 meters.For example, a town can have a temperature of 22° Celsius (71.6° Fahrenheit) at sea level. When the same village gets placed at a height of 2 000 meters (6561 feet) on a plateau, it can be as cold as 3.4° Celsius (38.1° Fahrenheit).\n",
      "\n",
      "How Does Altitude Affect Air Pressure?\n",
      "\n",
      "Atmospheric air has weight. It is not empty but consists of nitrogen, oxygen, argon, and other gases like carbon dioxide and methane. It also contains small particles like dust and pollen. This fact alone will help to explain the relationship between altitude and air pressure.\n",
      "\n",
      "At the surface of the planet, you have the whole weight of the atmosphere (specifically the troposphere) pressing down on you. The Earth's gravity is also at its strongest at surface level, causing the air particles close to the ground to compress the most.\n",
      "\n",
      "As an object starts to gain altitude, the atmospheric pressure around it begins to decrease. It is as a result of two factors. Firstly, with an increase in height, the amount of air above the subject starts to lessen, meaning the weight of air pressing down on it gets less as well.\n",
      "\n",
      "Secondly, the more altitude you gain, the further you are from the Earth's surface and its gravitational forces, so you experience less gravity. It allows the particles in the air to expand, which reduces the air pressure even further.\n",
      "\n",
      "In the upper troposphere and lower stratosphere, the atmospheric pressure is almost non-existent. The lack of oxygen is what makes life at this altitude impossible, but the thin air also allows airliners to fly without much air resistance and above any unstable weather.\n",
      "\n",
      "How Does Altitude Affect Precipitation?\n",
      "\n",
      "As already mentioned earlier in this post, temperatures continue to decrease as altitude keeps increasing. Atmospheric pressure also continues to drop with an increase in height.\n",
      "\n",
      "The combination of both processes contributes to locations at higher altitudes receiving a significantly higher amount of precipitation than low-lying regions. Please note that sufficient moisture must be present in the air for any precipitation to take place.\n",
      "\n",
      "The type of precipitation, however, depends on how low the temperature has dropped when condensation takes place.\n",
      "\n",
      "When condensation takes place while the temperature is above freezing point, precipitation is usually in the form of rain. When the water vapor condenses in sub-zero temperatures, though, it will be in the shape of snow or another solid form of water.\n",
      "\n",
      "Sometimes other factors such as physical barriers cause air to rise as well. The mountain effect is one such case. A change in the elevation of the physical terrain and not natural atmospheric processes forces air to gain altitude.\n",
      "\n",
      "Wind forces moisture-filled air to rise against a mountain, condensate, and result in precipitation on the windward side of the mountain, with warm, dry air flowing down on the leeward side. You can read all about this effect and how it occurs in this article.\n",
      "\n",
      "The Difference In Climate Between Low-Lying And Regions At High Altitudes\n",
      "\n",
      "Many of the climate conditions that are a result of an increase in altitude were highlighted throughout this post. A summary of these different conditions will explain just what a crucial role altitude plays in establishing the climate of any location.\n",
      "\n",
      "The best way to summarize the key differences between regions separated by altitude is to list the different weather conditions each one experience. (Just note that there are many other variables involved in forming the climate of any region.)\n",
      "\n",
      "Low-lying areas are typically characterized by:\n",
      "\n",
      "Warmer temperatures\n",
      "\n",
      "Less wind activity\n",
      "\n",
      "Lower amounts of precipitation\n",
      "\n",
      "Higher air pressure with high levels of oxygen\n",
      "\n",
      "High-altitude areas are typically characterized by:\n",
      "\n",
      "Colder temperatures\n",
      "\n",
      "Strong and gusty winds\n",
      "\n",
      "High amounts of precipitation\n",
      "\n",
      "Lower air pressure with low levels of oxygen\n",
      "\n",
      "As previously mentioned, these climate conditions can occur under a variety of conditions but are typical of the difference between locations at low and high altitudes.\n",
      "\n",
      "Conclusion\n",
      "\n",
      "As this article clearly illustrated, altitude causes lower-lying areas to have a very different climate than regions situated at a high altitude. If you experience any of the climate conditions described at the associated altitude, you now know why.\n",

      "Secondly, the more altitude you gain, the further you are from the Earth's surface and its gravitational forces, so you experience less gravity. It allows the particles in the air to expand, which reduces the air pressure even further.\n",
      "\n",
      "In the upper troposphere and lower stratosphere, the atmospheric pressure is almost non-existent. The lack of oxygen is what makes life at this altitude impossible, but the thin air also allows airliners to fly without much air resistance and above any unstable weather.\n",
      "\n",
      "How Does Altitude Affect Precipitation?\n",
      "\n",
      "As already mentioned earlier in this post, temperatures continue to decrease as altitude keeps increasing. Atmospheric pressure also continues to drop with an increase in height.\n",
      "\n",
      "The combination of both processes contributes to locations at higher altitudes receiving a significantly higher amount of precipitation than low-lying regions. Please note that sufficient moisture must be present in the air for any precipitation to take place.\n",
      "\n",
      "The type of precipitation, however, depends on how low the temperature has dropped when condensation takes place.\n",
      "\n",
      "When condensation takes place while the temperature is above freezing point, precipitation is usually in the form of rain. When the water vapor condenses in sub-zero temperatures, though, it will be in the shape of snow or another solid form of water.\n",
      "\n",
      "Sometimes other factors such as physical barriers cause air to rise as well. The mountain effect is one such case. A change in the elevation of the physical terrain and not natural atmospheric processes forces air to gain altitude.\n",
      "\n",
      "Wind forces moisture-filled air to rise against a mountain, condensate, and result in precipitation on the windward side of the mountain, with warm, dry air flowing down on the leeward side. You can read all about this effect and how it occurs in this article.\n",

      "How Does Altitude Affect Temperature?\n",
      "\n",
      "The Earth and atmosphere get warmed up as a result of the sun's solar radiation, specifically the infrared component of solar radiation. The infrared radiation warms up the land and oceans, which, in turn, warms up the air in the atmosphere.\n",
      "\n",
      "Since the atmosphere gets warmed up from the bottom up, the air is usually at its warmest at the surface of the planet and cools down as altitude increases.\n",
      "\n",
      "Although local variable conditions will influence the following figures, temperatures usually drop at a rate of 1° Celsius per 100 meters. More broadly put, temperatures fall by 5.4° Fahrenheit per 1 000 feet or 9.8° Celsius every 1 000 meters.For example, a town can have a temperature of 22° Celsius (71.6° Fahrenheit) at sea level. When the same village gets placed at a height of 2 000 meters (6561 feet) on a plateau, it can be as cold as 3.4° Celsius (38.1° Fahrenheit).\n",
      "\n",
      "How Does Altitude Affect Air Pressure?\n",
      "\n",
      "Atmospheric air has weight. It is not empty but consists of nitrogen, oxygen, argon, and other gases like carbon dioxide and methane. It also contains small particles like dust and pollen. This fact alone will help to explain the relationship between altitude and air pressure.\n",
      "\n",
      "At the surface of the planet, you have the whole weight of the atmosphere (specifically the troposphere) pressing down on you. The Earth's gravity is also at its strongest at surface level, causing the air particles close to the ground to compress the most.\n",
      "\n",
      "As an object starts to gain altitude, the atmospheric pressure around it begins to decrease. It is as a result of two factors. Firstly, with an increase in height, the amount of air above the subject starts to lessen, meaning the weight of air pressing down on it gets less as well.\n",

      "How Altitude Affects Climate\n",
      "\n",
      "When you live on the coast and travel inland to a region situated at a higher altitude, you quickly realize that the atmospheric conditions change significantly for some reason. The opposite is true as well.\n",
      "\n",
      "A region located at a higher altitude generally experiences colder temperatures and lower air pressures than a region situated at sea level. This is a result of both temperature and air pressure reaching their highest values close to the surface of the Earth and decreasing as altitude increases.\n",
      "\n",
      "At a few thousand feet or higher above sea level, the climate you experience is very different from the climate you will find in a coastal town. It all has to do with how weather elements change with an increase in altitude within the atmosphere.\n",
      "\n",
      "This article examines what causes these changes in weather elements as altitude increase, and also look at the prevailing weather conditions in a location at a high altitude compared to the environment at sea level.\n",

      "A quick word about climate: There are similarities but also significant differences between weather and climate. Weather is the atmospheric condition at any given time at a specific location.\n",
      "\n",
      "Climate, however, is the average atmospheric conditions in a specific location calculated over a prolonged period. (At least 30 years in most cases.) You can read the in-depth article describing the difference between Weather and Climate by following this link.\n",
      "\n",
      "How Does Altitude Affect Climate?\n",
      "\n",
      "Before we look at what the climate conditions are like at a location a few thousand feet above sea level and then contrast it against a similar environment at sea level, one needs to see how an increase in altitude affects the different weather variables:\n",
      "\n",
      "But first, one needs to address the difference between altitude and elevation.\n",
      "\n",
      "Altitude vs. Elevation\n",
      "\n",
      "In meteorology and aviation, altitude generally refers to an object/location's height above sea level. Elevation, though, refers to the height of an object relative to the physical terrain (ground level) beneath it.\n",
      "\n",
      "In aviation, altitude also has a few different meanings. Here is a quick summary:\n",
      "\n",
      "Indicated Altitude: The altitude displayed on the altimeter.\n",
      "\n",
      "Absolute Altitude: The distance between the aircraft and the ground below it.\n",
      "\n",
      "True Altitude: The height of the aircraft above sea level.\n",
      "\n",
      "Height: The vertical distance between the aircraft and a specific point below it.\n",
      "\n",
      "Pressure and Density Altitude also gets used, but it may make things too confusing and is not relevant to the context within which this article uses altitude.\n",
      "\n",
      "For the purpose of this post, altitude will always refer to an object's height above sea level.\n",
      "\n",
      "One can now focus on the different elements and how altitude affects them:\n",

      "In the task of predicting age of an abalone (by predicting number of rings) through its physical characteristics, the OLS regression model works best with a MAE of 1.5.. All over, robustness regression models do a good job in dealing with outliers present in the abalone dataset. Techniques such as SMOTE and Cross Validation do not improve the performance of the models . This cements its position as the best model. Normalization of attributes seems to result in the same performance as un normalized data. The scatter plots for individual folds of cross validations show that Mean Absolute Error can be brought down below 1 for certain arrangements of data, the best being 0.936. However, it also shows that the error is still above the acceptable limits in some regions. It is the author‚Äôs belief that given an adequate and balanced dataset, OLS along with SMOTE and Cross Validation can achieve the goal of Mean Absolute Error less than 0.5 across all the labels\n",

The original data set contains the nine variables sex, length, diameter, height, whole weight, shucked weight, viscera weight, shell weight and number of rings. The num- ber of rings in the shell is directly related to the age of the snail: adding 1.5 to the num- ber of rings gives the age in years.

After merging the data sets, we selected the following six variables: altitude, latitude, longitude, and annual mean values (over the years 1961–1990) of sun- shine duration, temperature and precipitation. We converted the latitude and longitude variables from sexagesimal to decimal notation. Out of these six variables, we selected six diﬀerent pairs with “obvious” causal relationships: altitude–temperature (pair0001), altitude–precipitation (pair0002), longitude–temperature (pair0003), altitude–sunshine hours (pair0004), latitute–temperature (pair0020), and longitude–precipitation (pair0021).\n",

      "This data set, available at the UCI Machine Learning Repository (Bache and Lichman, 2013), concerns a systematic study (Yeh, 1998) regarding concrete compressive strength as a function of ingredients and age. Citing (Yeh, 1998): “High-performance concrete (HPC) is a new terminology used in the concrete construction industry. In addition to the three basic ingredients in conventional concrete, i.e., Portland cement, ﬁne and coarse aggregates, and water, the making of HPC needs to incorporate supplementary cementitious materials, such as ﬂy ash and blast furnace slag, and chemical admixture, such as superplasticizer 1 and 2. Several studies independently have shown that concrete strength development is determined not only by the water-to-cement ratio, but that it also is inﬂuenced by the content of other concrete ingredients.” Compressive strength is measured in units of MPa, age in days, and the other variables are measured in kilograms per cubic metre of concrete mixture. The dataset was downloaded from https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Concrete+ Compressive+Strength and contains 1030 measurements.\n",

      "This data set, available at the UCI Machine Learning Repository (Bache and Lichman, 2013), concerns a systematic study (Yeh, 1998) regarding concrete compressive strength as a function of ingredients and age. Citing (Yeh, 1998): “High-performance concrete (HPC) is a new terminology used in the concrete construction industry. In addition to the three basic ingredients in conventional concrete, i.e., Portland cement, ﬁne and coarse aggregates, and water, the making of HPC needs to incorporate supplementary cementitious materials, such as ﬂy ash and blast furnace slag, and chemical admixture, such as superplasticizer 1 and 2. Several studies independently have shown that concrete strength development is determined not only by the water-to-cement ratio, but that it also is inﬂuenced by the content of other concrete ingredients.” Compressive strength is measured in units of MPa, age in days, and the other variables are measured in kilograms per cubic metre of concrete mixture. The dataset was downloaded from https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Concrete+ Compressive+Strength and contains 1030 measurements.\n",

We down- loaded the data from http://www.dwd.de and merged several of the original data sets to obtain data for 349 weather stations in Germany, selecting only those weather stations without missing data. After merging the data sets, we selected the following six variables: altitude, latitude, longitude, and annual mean values (over the years 1961–1990) of sun- shine duration, temperature and precipitation. We converted the latitude and longitude variables from sexagesimal to decimal notation. Out of these six variables, we selected six diﬀerent pairs with “obvious” causal relationships: altitude–temperature (pair0001), altitude–precipitation (pair0002), longitude–temperature (pair0003), altitude–sunshine hours (pair0004), latitute–temperature (pair0020), and longitude–precipitation (pair0021).\n",

Citing (Yeh, 1998): “High-performance concrete (HPC) is a new terminology used in the concrete construction industry. In addition to the three basic ingredients in conventional concrete, i.e., Portland cement, ﬁne and coarse aggregates, and water, the making of HPC needs to incorporate supplementary cementitious materials, such as ﬂy ash and blast furnace slag, and chemical admixture, such as superplasticizer 1 and 2. Several studies independently have shown that concrete strength development is determined not only by the water-to-cement ratio, but that it also is inﬂuenced by the content of other concrete ingredients.” Compressive strength is measured in units of MPa, age in days, and the other variables are measured in kilograms per cubic metre of concrete mixture. The dataset was downloaded from https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Concrete+ Compressive+Strength and contains 1030 measurements.\n",

There is no doubt that altitude is the cause and temperature the eﬀect: one could easily think of an intervention where the thermometer is lifted (e.g., by using a balloon) to measure the temperature at a higher point of the same longitude and latitude. On the other hand, heating or cooling a location usually does not change its altitude (except perhaps if the location happens to be the space enclosed by a hot air balloon, but let us assume that the thermometers used to gather this data were ﬁxed to the ground). The altitudes in the DWD data set range from 0 m to 2960 m, which is suﬃciently large to detect signiﬁcant statistical dependences.\n",

The places with the highest average temperatures are therefore those with low altitude but lying far in the south.

This eﬀect deﬁnes an indirect causal inﬂuence of altitude on precipitation via temperature. These causal relations are, however, less simple than the causal inﬂuence from altitude to temperature because gradients of the altitude with respect to the main direction of the wind are more relevant than the altitude itself. A hypothetical intervention that would allow us to validate the causal relation could be to build artiﬁcial mountains and observe orographic rainfall.\n",

Moving a sunshine sensor above the clouds clearly increases the sunshine duration whereas installing an artiﬁcial sun would not change the altitude. The causal inﬂuence from altitude to sun- shine duration can be confounded, for instance, by the fact that there is a simple statistical dependence between altitude and longitude in Germany as explained earlier.\n",

In addition to the three basic ingredients in conventional concrete, i.e., Portland cement, ﬁne and coarse aggregates, and water, the making of HPC needs to incorporate supplementary cementitious materials, such as ﬂy ash and blast furnace slag, and chemical admixture, such as superplasticizer 1 and 2. Several studies independently have shown that concrete strength development is determined not only by the water-to-cement ratio, but that it also is inﬂuenced by the content of other concrete ingredients.” Compressive strength is measured in units of MPa, age in days, and the other variables are measured in kilograms per cubic metre of concrete mixture.

In addition to the three basic ingredients in conventional concrete, i.e., Portland cement, ﬁne and coarse aggregates, and water, the making of HPC needs to incorporate supplementary cementitious materials, such as ﬂy ash and blast furnace slag, and chemical admixture, such as superplasticizer 1 and 2. Several studies independently have shown that concrete strength development is determined not only by the water-to-cement ratio, but that it also is inﬂuenced by the content of other concrete ingredients.” Compressive strength is measured in units of MPa, age in days, and the other variables are measured in kilograms per cubic metre of concrete mixture.

Disulﬁram, a drug that inhibits ALDH, also leads to these symptoms when alcohol is taken, and may be given to reinforce abstinence from alcohol.” This means that a priori, a reverse causation of the chemical whose concentration is mea- sured in one of these blood tests on daily alcohol consumption cannot be excluded with certainty.

In addition to the three basic ingredients in conventional concrete, i.e., Portland cement, ﬁne and coarse aggregates, and water, the making of HPC needs to incorporate supplementary cementitious materials, such as ﬂy ash and blast furnace slag, and chemical admixture, such as superplasticizer 1 and 2. Several studies independently have shown that concrete strength development is determined not only by the water-to-cement ratio, but that it also is inﬂuenced by the content of other concrete ingredients.” Compressive strength is measured in units of MPa, age in days, and the other variables are measured in kilograms per cubic metre of concrete mixture.

In addition to the three basic ingredients in conventional concrete, i.e., Portland cement, ﬁne and coarse aggregates, and water, the making of HPC needs to incorporate supplementary cementitious materials, such as ﬂy ash and blast furnace slag, and chemical admixture, such as superplasticizer 1 and 2. Several studies independently have shown that concrete strength development is determined not only by the water-to-cement ratio, but that it also is inﬂuenced by the content of other concrete ingredients.” Compressive strength is measured in units of MPa, age in days, and the other variables are measured in kilograms per cubic metre of concrete mixture.

      "This data set, available from the NOAA (National Oceanic and Atmospheric Adminis- tration) Earth System Research Laboratory website at http://www.esrl.noaa.gov/psd/ data/gridded/data.ncep.reanalysis.surface.html, is a subset of a reanalysis data set, incorporating observations and numerical weather prediction model output from 1948 to date (Kalnay et al., 1996). The reanalysis data set was produced by the National Center for Environmental Prediction (NCEP) and the National Center for Atmospheric Research (NCAR). Reanalysis data products aim for a realistic representation of all relevant climato- logical variables on a spatiotemporal grid. We collected four variables from a global grid of 144 × 73 cells: air temperature (in K, pair0043), surface pressure (in Pascal, pair0044), sea level pressure (in Pascal, pair0045) and relative humidity (in %, pair0045) on two consecutive days, day 50 and day 51 of the year 2000 (i.e., Feb 19th and 20th). Each data pair consists of 144 × 73 − 143 = 10369 data points, distributed across the globe. 143 data points were subtracted because at the north pole values are repeated across all longitudes. Each data point is the daily average over an area that covers 2.5◦ × 2.5◦ (approximately 250 km × 250 km at the equator). Because causal inﬂuence cannot propagate backwards in time, temperature, pressure and humidity in a certain area are partly aﬀected by their value the day before in the same area.\n",

      "This data set deals with the relationship between daily ozone concentration in the air and temperature. It was downloaded from http://www.bafu.admin.ch/luft/luftbelastung/ blick_zurueck/datenabfrage/index.html. Lower atmosphere ozone (O3) is a secondary pollutant that is produced by the photochemical oxidation of carbon monoxide (CO), methane (CH4), and non-methane volatile organic compounds (NMVOCs) by OH in the presence of nitrogen oxides (NOx, NO + NO2) (Rasmussen et al., 2012). It is known that ozone concentration strongly correlates with surface temperature (Bloomer et al., 2009). Several explanations are given in the literature (see e.g., Rasmussen et al., 2012). Without going into details of the complex underlying chemical processes, we mention that the crucial chemical reactions are stronger at higher temperatures. For instance, isoprene emissions of plants increase with increasing temperature and isoprene can play a similar role in the generation of O3 as NOx (Rasmussen et al., 2012). Apart from this, air pollution may be inﬂuenced indirectly by temperature, e.g., via increasing traﬃc at ‘good’ weather conditions or an increased occurrence rate of wildﬁres. All these explanations state a causal path from temperature to ozone. Note that the phenomenon of ozone pollution in the lower atmo- sphere discussed here should not be confused with the ‘ozone hole’, which is a lack of ozone in the higher atmosphere. Close to the surface, ozone concentration does not have an impact on temperatures. For all three data sets, ozone is measured in µg/m3 and temperature in ◦C.\n",

      "This data set deals with the relationship between daily ozone concentration in the air and temperature. It was downloaded from http://www.bafu.admin.ch/luft/luftbelastung/ blick_zurueck/datenabfrage/index.html. Lower atmosphere ozone (O3) is a secondary pollutant that is produced by the photochemical oxidation of carbon monoxide (CO), methane (CH4), and non-methane volatile organic compounds (NMVOCs) by OH in the presence of nitrogen oxides (NOx, NO + NO2) (Rasmussen et al., 2012). It is known that ozone concentration strongly correlates with surface temperature (Bloomer et al., 2009). Several explanations are given in the literature (see e.g., Rasmussen et al., 2012). Without going into details of the complex underlying chemical processes, we mention that the crucial chemical reactions are stronger at higher temperatures. For instance, isoprene emissions of plants increase with increasing temperature and isoprene can play a similar role in the generation of O3 as NOx (Rasmussen et al., 2012). Apart from this, air pollution may be inﬂuenced indirectly by temperature, e.g., via increasing traﬃc at ‘good’ weather conditions or an increased occurrence rate of wildﬁres. All these explanations state a causal path from temperature to ozone. Note that the phenomenon of ozone pollution in the lower atmo- sphere discussed here should not be confused with the ‘ozone hole’, which is a lack of ozone in the higher atmosphere. Close to the surface, ozone concentration does not have an impact on temperatures. For all three data sets, ozone is measured in µg/m3 and temperature in ◦C.\n",

The reanalysis data set was produced by the National Center for Environmental Prediction (NCEP) and the National Center for Atmospheric Research (NCAR). Reanalysis data products aim for a realistic representation of all relevant climato- logical variables on a spatiotemporal grid. We collected four variables from a global grid of 144 × 73 cells: air temperature (in K, pair0043), surface pressure (in Pascal, pair0044), sea level pressure (in Pascal, pair0045) and relative humidity (in %, pair0045) on two consecutive days, day 50 and day 51 of the year 2000 (i.e., Feb 19th and 20th). Each data pair consists of 144 × 73 − 143 = 10369 data points, distributed across the globe. 143 data points were subtracted because at the north pole values are repeated across all longitudes. Each data point is the daily average over an area that covers 2.5◦ × 2.5◦ (approximately 250 km × 250 km at the equator). Because causal inﬂuence cannot propagate backwards in time, temperature, pressure and humidity in a certain area are partly aﬀected by their value the day before in the same area.\n",

      "This data set deals with the relationship between daily ozone concentration in the air and temperature. It was downloaded from http://www.bafu.admin.ch/luft/luftbelastung/ blick_zurueck/datenabfrage/index.html. Lower atmosphere ozone (O3) is a secondary pollutant that is produced by the photochemical oxidation of carbon monoxide (CO), methane (CH4), and non-methane volatile organic compounds (NMVOCs) by OH in the presence of nitrogen oxides (NOx, NO + NO2) (Rasmussen et al., 2012). It is known that ozone concentration strongly correlates with surface temperature (Bloomer et al., 2009). Several explanations are given in the literature (see e.g., Rasmussen et al., 2012). Without going into details of the complex underlying chemical processes, we mention that the crucial chemical reactions are stronger at higher temperatures. For instance, isoprene emissions of plants increase with increasing temperature and isoprene can play a similar role in the generation of O3 as NOx (Rasmussen et al., 2012). Apart from this, air pollution may be inﬂuenced indirectly by temperature, e.g., via increasing traﬃc at ‘good’ weather conditions or an increased occurrence rate of wildﬁres. All these explanations state a causal path from temperature to ozone. Note that the phenomenon of ozone pollution in the lower atmo- sphere discussed here should not be confused with the ‘ozone hole’, which is a lack of ozone in the higher atmosphere. Close to the surface, ozone concentration does not have an impact on temperatures. For all three data sets, ozone is measured in µg/m3 and temperature in ◦C.\n",

      "This data set deals with the relationship between daily ozone concentration in the air and temperature. It was downloaded from http://www.bafu.admin.ch/luft/luftbelastung/ blick_zurueck/datenabfrage/index.html. Lower atmosphere ozone (O3) is a secondary pollutant that is produced by the photochemical oxidation of carbon monoxide (CO), methane (CH4), and non-methane volatile organic compounds (NMVOCs) by OH in the presence of nitrogen oxides (NOx, NO + NO2) (Rasmussen et al., 2012). It is known that ozone concentration strongly correlates with surface temperature (Bloomer et al., 2009). Several explanations are given in the literature (see e.g., Rasmussen et al., 2012). Without going into details of the complex underlying chemical processes, we mention that the crucial chemical reactions are stronger at higher temperatures. For instance, isoprene emissions of plants increase with increasing temperature and isoprene can play a similar role in the generation of O3 as NOx (Rasmussen et al., 2012). Apart from this, air pollution may be inﬂuenced indirectly by temperature, e.g., via increasing traﬃc at ‘good’ weather conditions or an increased occurrence rate of wildﬁres. All these explanations state a causal path from temperature to ozone. Note that the phenomenon of ozone pollution in the lower atmo- sphere discussed here should not be confused with the ‘ozone hole’, which is a lack of ozone in the higher atmosphere. Close to the surface, ozone concentration does not have an impact on temperatures. For all three data sets, ozone is measured in µg/m3 and temperature in ◦C.\n",

However, the performance of current state-of-the-art bivariate causal discovery methods still has to be improved further in order to enable practical applications, and more validation data are needed in order to obtain statistically signiﬁcant conclusions. Furthermore, it is not clear at this stage under what assumptions current methods could be extended to deal with possible confounding variables, an important issue in practice.\n",

      "In this Appendix, we prove the consistency of Algorithm 1 with score (7), which is closely related to the algorithm originally proposed by Hoyer et al. (2009) that uses score (5). The main diﬀerence is that the original implementation uses the HSIC p-value, whereas here, we use the HSIC value itself as a score. Also, we consider the option of splitting the dataset into one part for regression and another part for independence testing. Finally, we ﬁx the HSIC kernel instead of letting its bandwidth be chosen by a heuristic that depends on the data. The reason that we make these small modiﬁcations is that they lead to an easier proof of consistency of the method.\n",

There is evidence that the Earth’s climate heats and cools as solar activity rises and falls (Haigh, 2007), and the sunspot number can be seen as a proxy for solar activity. Also, we do not believe that the Earth’s surface temperature (or changes of the Earth’s atmosphere) has an inﬂuence on the activity of the sun.

The temperature data is expressed in deviations from the 1961–90 mean global temperature of the Earth (i.e., monthly anomalies). The sunspot data (Hathaway, 2010) are taken from the National Aeronautics and Space Administration and were downloaded from http://solarscience.msfc.nasa.gov/SunspotCycle.shtml. According to the description on that website, “sunspot number is calculated by ﬁrst counting the number of sunspot groups and then the number of individual sunspots. The sunspot number is then given by the sum of the number of individual sunspots and ten times the number of groups. Since most sunspot groups have, on average, about ten spots, this formula for counting sunspots gives reliable numbers even when the observing conditions are less than ideal and small spots are hard to see.”\n",

Although the causes of sunspots are not entirely understood, there is a signiﬁcant dependence between the number of sunspots and the global mean temperature anomalies (p-value for zero correlation is less than 10−4). There is evidence that the Earth’s climate heats and cools as solar activity rises and falls (Haigh, 2007), and the sunspot number can be seen as a proxy for solar activity. Also, we do not believe that the Earth’s surface temperature (or changes of the Earth’s atmosphere) has an inﬂuence on the activity of the sun.

Although the causes of sunspots are not entirely understood, there is a signiﬁcant dependence between the number of sunspots and the global mean temperature anomalies (p-value for zero correlation is less than 10−4). There is evidence that the Earth’s climate heats and cools as solar activity rises and falls (Haigh, 2007), and the sunspot number can be seen as a proxy for solar activity. Also, we do not believe that the Earth’s surface temperature (or changes of the Earth’s atmosphere) has an inﬂuence on the activity of the sun.

NEP is a measure of the net CO2 ﬂux between the biosphere and the atmosphere, mainly driven It is deﬁned as the photosynthetic carbon uptake minus the carbon by biotic activity. release by respiration, and depends on the available light. NEP is measured in units of µmol CO2 m−2 s−1. PPFD measures light intensity in terms of photons that are available for photosynthesis, i.e., with wavelength between 400 nm and 700 nm (visible light). More precisely, PPFD is deﬁned as the number of photons with wavelength of 400–700 nm falling on a certain area per time interval, measured in units of µmol photons m−2 s−1. The total PPFD is the sum of PPFDdif, which measures only diﬀusive photons, and PPFDdir, which measures only direct (solar light) photons.

Although the causes of sunspots are not entirely understood, there is a signiﬁcant dependence between the number of sunspots and the global mean temperature anomalies (p-value for zero correlation is less than 10−4). There is evidence that the Earth’s climate heats and cools as solar activity rises and falls (Haigh, 2007), and the sunspot number can be seen as a proxy for solar activity. Also, we do not believe that the Earth’s surface temperature (or changes of the Earth’s atmosphere) has an inﬂuence on the activity of the sun.

      "This data set deals with the relationship between daily ozone concentration in the air and temperature. It was downloaded from http://www.bafu.admin.ch/luft/luftbelastung/ blick_zurueck/datenabfrage/index.html. Lower atmosphere ozone (O3) is a secondary pollutant that is produced by the photochemical oxidation of carbon monoxide (CO), methane (CH4), and non-methane volatile organic compounds (NMVOCs) by OH in the presence of nitrogen oxides (NOx, NO + NO2) (Rasmussen et al., 2012). It is known that ozone concentration strongly correlates with surface temperature (Bloomer et al., 2009). Several explanations are given in the literature (see e.g., Rasmussen et al., 2012). Without going into details of the complex underlying chemical processes, we mention that the crucial chemical reactions are stronger at higher temperatures. For instance, isoprene emissions of plants increase with increasing temperature and isoprene can play a similar role in the generation of O3 as NOx (Rasmussen et al., 2012). Apart from this, air pollution may be inﬂuenced indirectly by temperature, e.g., via increasing traﬃc at ‘good’ weather conditions or an increased occurrence rate of wildﬁres. All these explanations state a causal path from temperature to ozone. Note that the phenomenon of ozone pollution in the lower atmo- sphere discussed here should not be confused with the ‘ozone hole’, which is a lack of ozone in the higher atmosphere. Close to the surface, ozone concentration does not have an impact on temperatures. For all three data sets, ozone is measured in µg/m3 and temperature in ◦C.\n",

      "This data set deals with the relationship between daily ozone concentration in the air and temperature. It was downloaded from http://www.bafu.admin.ch/luft/luftbelastung/ blick_zurueck/datenabfrage/index.html. Lower atmosphere ozone (O3) is a secondary pollutant that is produced by the photochemical oxidation of carbon monoxide (CO), methane (CH4), and non-methane volatile organic compounds (NMVOCs) by OH in the presence of nitrogen oxides (NOx, NO + NO2) (Rasmussen et al., 2012). It is known that ozone concentration strongly correlates with surface temperature (Bloomer et al., 2009). Several explanations are given in the literature (see e.g., Rasmussen et al., 2012). Without going into details of the complex underlying chemical processes, we mention that the crucial chemical reactions are stronger at higher temperatures. For instance, isoprene emissions of plants increase with increasing temperature and isoprene can play a similar role in the generation of O3 as NOx (Rasmussen et al., 2012). Apart from this, air pollution may be inﬂuenced indirectly by temperature, e.g., via increasing traﬃc at ‘good’ weather conditions or an increased occurrence rate of wildﬁres. All these explanations state a causal path from temperature to ozone. Note that the phenomenon of ozone pollution in the lower atmo- sphere discussed here should not be confused with the ‘ozone hole’, which is a lack of ozone in the higher atmosphere. Close to the surface, ozone concentration does not have an impact on temperatures. For all three data sets, ozone is measured in µg/m3 and temperature in ◦C.\n",

There might be an eﬀect that the employment status inﬂuences the decision to get children but we regard this eﬀect to be less relevant.\n",

Both variables are most likely also confounded by the availability of food, driven for instance by advances in agriculture and subsequently increasing yields, but also by national and international conﬂicts, the global food market and other economic factors. However, for the short time period considered here, confounders which mainly inﬂuence the variables on a temporal scale can probably be neglected. Their might also be a causal link from food consumption growth to population growth, for instance one could imagine that if people are well fed, they also reproduce more.

      "This data set is extracted from that for the milk protein trial used by Verbyla and Cullis (1990). The original data set consists of assayed protein content of milk samples taken weekly from each of 79 cows. The cows were randomly allocated to one of three diets: barley, mixed barley-lupins, and lupins, with 25, 27 and 27 cows in the three groups, respectively. Measurements were taken for up to 19 weeks but there were 38 drop-outs from week 15 onwards, corresponding to cows who stopped producing milk before the end of the experiment. We removed the missing values (drop-outs) in the data set: we did not consider the measurements from week 15 onwards, which contain many drop-outs, and we discarded the cows with drop-outs before week 15. Finally, the data set contains 71 cows and 14 weeks, i.e., 994 samples in total. Furthermore, we re-organized the data set to see the relationship between the milk protein and the time to take the measurement. We selected two variables: the time to take weekly measurements (from 1 to 14), and the protein content of the milk produced by each cow at that time.\n",

      "This data set, available at the UCI Machine Learning Repository (Bache and Lichman, 2013), concerns a systematic study (Yeh, 1998) regarding concrete compressive strength as a function of ingredients and age. Citing (Yeh, 1998): “High-performance concrete (HPC) is a new terminology used in the concrete construction industry. In addition to the three basic ingredients in conventional concrete, i.e., Portland cement, ﬁne and coarse aggregates, and water, the making of HPC needs to incorporate supplementary cementitious materials, such as ﬂy ash and blast furnace slag, and chemical admixture, such as superplasticizer 1 and 2. Several studies independently have shown that concrete strength development is determined not only by the water-to-cement ratio, but that it also is inﬂuenced by the content of other concrete ingredients.” Compressive strength is measured in units of MPa, age in days, and the other variables are measured in kilograms per cubic metre of concrete mixture. The dataset was downloaded from https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Concrete+ Compressive+Strength and contains 1030 measurements.\n",

Citing (Yeh, 1998): “High-performance concrete (HPC) is a new terminology used in the concrete construction industry. In addition to the three basic ingredients in conventional concrete, i.e., Portland cement, ﬁne and coarse aggregates, and water, the making of HPC needs to incorporate supplementary cementitious materials, such as ﬂy ash and blast furnace slag, and chemical admixture, such as superplasticizer 1 and 2. Several studies independently have shown that concrete strength development is determined not only by the water-to-cement ratio, but that it also is inﬂuenced by the content of other concrete ingredients.” Compressive strength is measured in units of MPa, age in days, and the other variables are measured in kilograms per cubic metre of concrete mixture. The dataset was downloaded from https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Concrete+ Compressive+Strength and contains 1030 measurements.\n",

      "This data set, available at the UCI Machine Learning Repository (Bache and Lichman, 2013), concerns a systematic study (Yeh, 1998) regarding concrete compressive strength as a function of ingredients and age. Citing (Yeh, 1998): “High-performance concrete (HPC) is a new terminology used in the concrete construction industry. In addition to the three basic ingredients in conventional concrete, i.e., Portland cement, ﬁne and coarse aggregates, and water, the making of HPC needs to incorporate supplementary cementitious materials, such as ﬂy ash and blast furnace slag, and chemical admixture, such as superplasticizer 1 and 2. Several studies independently have shown that concrete strength development is determined not only by the water-to-cement ratio, but that it also is inﬂuenced by the content of other concrete ingredients.” Compressive strength is measured in units of MPa, age in days, and the other variables are measured in kilograms per cubic metre of concrete mixture. The dataset was downloaded from https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Concrete+ Compressive+Strength and contains 1030 measurements.\n",

      "It should be obvious that compressive strength is the eﬀect, and the other variables are its causes. Note, however, that in practice one cannot easily intervene on the mixture components without simultaneously changing the other mixture components. For example, if one adds more water to the mixture, then as a result, all other components will decrease, as they are measured in kilograms per cubic metre of concrete mixture. Nevertheless, we expect that we can see these interventions as reasonable approximations of “perfect interventions” on a single variable.\n",

      "This data set, available at the UCI Machine Learning Repository (Bache and Lichman, 2013), concerns a systematic study (Yeh, 1998) regarding concrete compressive strength as a function of ingredients and age. Citing (Yeh, 1998): “High-performance concrete (HPC) is a new terminology used in the concrete construction industry. In addition to the three basic ingredients in conventional concrete, i.e., Portland cement, ﬁne and coarse aggregates, and water, the making of HPC needs to incorporate supplementary cementitious materials, such as ﬂy ash and blast furnace slag, and chemical admixture, such as superplasticizer 1 and 2. Several studies independently have shown that concrete strength development is determined not only by the water-to-cement ratio, but that it also is inﬂuenced by the content of other concrete ingredients.” Compressive strength is measured in units of MPa, age in days, and the other variables are measured in kilograms per cubic metre of concrete mixture. The dataset was downloaded from https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Concrete+ Compressive+Strength and contains 1030 measurements.\n",

The deposition of ozone is driven by complex micrometeorological processes including wind direction, air temperature, and global radiation (Stockwell et al., 1997). For instance, solar radiation aﬀects the height of the planetary boundary layer and cloud formation and thus indirectly inﬂuences ozone concentrations.

This is about four times as much as the current number of 37 (weighted) pairs in the CauseEffectPairs benchmark. Therefore, we suggest that at this point, the highest priority regarding future work should be to obtain more validation data, rather than developing additional methods or optimizing computation time of existing methods. We hope that our publication of the CauseEffectPairs benchmark data inspires researchers to collaborate on this important task and we invite everybody to contribute pairs to the CauseEffectPairs benchmark data.\n",
